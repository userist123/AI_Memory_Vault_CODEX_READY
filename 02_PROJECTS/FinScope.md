# Project: FinScope

## 1. Description
**FinScope** is a local-first, privacy-focused personal financial intelligence web application built with **React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Dexie (IndexedDB), Zustand, TailwindCSS, and Recharts**.

## 2. Core Capabilities
- **Local-First Storage**: IndexedDB via Dexie for offline zero-cloud latency and total data privacy.
- **Multi-Format Ingestion**: Ingest bank statements via PDF (`pdfjs-dist`), Excel (`xlsx`), CSV (`papaparse`), and OCR scanned images (`tesseract.js`).
- **Rule-Based Engine**: Smart auto-categorization and transaction rule mapping.
- **Analytics & Forecasting**: Recharts visualization for cashflow, recurring subscriptions, and budget tracking.

## 3. Location & Environment
- **Path**: `C:\Users\Marius\finscope`
- **Orchestration**: Multi-Agent Orchestrator via secure delegation (`cognitive_core/dispatch_cli.py`, gated by P0-P15 `MemoryController`).
