"""Compile an informal request into a complete English task prompt.

The user states an intent in one line, in Romanian. What reaches another agent
must be a full English brief: verified context, explicit requirements, the
traps that already cost this repository time, the method for measuring, and
acceptance criteria that can fail.

This script does the deterministic half. It reads the vault's live state and
emits a skeleton already populated with facts nobody should have to look up
again: the current commit, the test baseline, corpus and graph sizes, the
recorded methods, and the standing traps. The agent fills in the parts that
require judgement — the task itself, its requirements, what is forbidden, and
what "done" looks like.

Everything emitted is English regardless of the language of the request, per
`01_ARCHITECTURE/memory/Preferences/AI_Facing_Prompts_In_English.md`. Detail
lost in translation is detail lost.

## Verified context — measured, do not re-derive

{state}

Read `00_GOVERNANCE/VAULT_STATE.md` before anything else. It records what is
verified true right now and outranks README, CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md wherever
they disagree.

## Task

{task}

## Requirements — {intent_name}

{requirements}
{n_plus_one}. Zero regression against the stated baseline. Any deviation is
   explained commit by commit.
{n_plus_two}. TODO — anything specific to this task that the kind alone does not cover.

## Forbidden

{forbidden}
- Do not modify a benchmark, threshold or gate to make a result pass. If a gate
  blocks the work, report it blocked.
- TODO — anything out of scope for this task specifically.

## Methods already recorded — read before diagnosing

{methods}

## Standing traps

{traps}

## Skills and data to consult

{skills}

If the task needs a capability none of these cover, say so explicitly rather
than improvising one.

## Method

Isolated worktree at a short path, cherry-pick your commits onto the baseline,
run the suite in both, and diff the FAILED name sets:

    git worktree add --detach C:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/<name> <base-sha>
    git -C C:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/<name> config core.longpaths true

## Deliverables

{deliverables}
{d_plus_one}. Measurement against the baseline, reported as numbers with an n.
{d_plus_two}. Remaining gaps, stated as gaps.

## Acceptance — a task is finished when all five hold

1. Implemented and committed.
2. Verified by something that would have failed if the change were wrong. A
   green suite is not this on its own.
3. Regressions measured against a stated baseline, in isolation.
4. What remains open written down explicitly, including "nothing".
5. The method recorded per
   `10_DOCUMENTATION/procedures/Recording_A_Solved_Problem.md` if it transfers.

Anything less is unfinished and must be reported as unfinished, with the
remainder named.
