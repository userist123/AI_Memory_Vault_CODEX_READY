 * A simple implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern in JavaScript. This class allows you to wrap calls to external services and automatically handle failures by opening the circuit after a certain number of consecutive failures, and then allowing a limited number of test requests after a cooldown period to determine if the service has recovered.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * const circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker({ failureThreshold: 5, cooldownMs: 30000 }
 * circuitBreaker.allowRequest() // returns true if request is allowed, false if circuit is open
 * circuitBreaker.onSuccess() // call this when a request succeeds
 * circuitBreaker.onFailure() // call this when a request fails
 * 
 * The circuit breaker will automatically transition between states (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN) based on the success and failure of requests, and will log state changes and metrics for monitoring purposes.
