# RAG Document Q&A with Svelte

> The uploaded document list, answer, and cited passages shown above are **illustrative** — an OpenAI API key is required for live embeddings and answers. The empty-document and upload error states are captured against the real backend.

Upload documents and ask questions using Retrieval Augmented Generation with vector search.

## Architecture

**Run Mode:**
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User --> Svelte[Vite Dev Server<br/>HMR enabled]
    Svelte -->|Proxy /api| API[FastAPI]
    API --> Qdrant[Qdrant Vector DB]
    API --> OpenAI[OpenAI API]
```

**Publish Mode:**
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User --> API[FastAPI serving<br/>Vite build output<br/>'npm run build']
    API --> Qdrant[Qdrant Vector DB]
    API --> OpenAI[OpenAI API]
```

## What This Demonstrates

- **RAG Pattern**: Document upload → chunk → embed → vector search → GPT answer
- **addUvicornApp**: Python FastAPI backend with uv package manager
- **addViteApp**: Svelte 5 frontend with Vite
- **addQdrant**: Vector database for semantic search
- **addOpenAI**: Secure API key management
- **publishWithContainerFiles**: Frontend embedded in API for publish mode

## Running

```bash
aspire run
```

Aspire will prompt for your OpenAI API key on first run.

## Security Notes

This is a local-first sample, not a production-ready document service. Uploaded documents are untrusted input and the API only accepts UTF-8 `.txt` text uploads with size, chunk, question length, and per-client rate limits to reduce accidental OpenAI cost or quota burn.

RAG apps can be affected by prompt injection and data disclosure risks because retrieved document text is placed into model context. The sample does not provide tenant isolation, document deletion controls, malware/content scanning, or durable data-retention policies.

Before adapting this for production, add real authentication and authorization, data retention and deletion workflows, monitoring, and malware/content scanning as appropriate for your data.

## Commands

```bash
aspire run      # Run locally
aspire deploy   # Deploy to Docker Compose
aspire do docker-compose-down-dc  # Teardown deployment
```

## Key Aspire Patterns

**Static File Embedding** - Frontend proxied in run mode, embedded in publish mode:
```ts
const openAiApiKey = await builder.addParameter("openai-api-key", { secret: true });
const qdrant = await builder.addQdrant("qdrant");

await builder.addOpenAI("openai")
    .withApiKey(openAiApiKey);

const api = await builder.addUvicornApp("api", "./api", "main:app")
    .withUv()
    .waitFor(qdrant)
    .withReference(qdrant)
    .withEnvironment("OPENAI_APIKEY", openAiApiKey);

const frontend = await builder.addViteApp("frontend", "./frontend")
    .withReference(api)
    .withUrl("", { displayText: "RAG UI" });

await api.publishWithContainerFiles(frontend, "public");
```

**Python + uv** - Fast dependency installation from `pyproject.toml`

**Vector Database** - `addQdrant()` for semantic search

**OpenAI Integration** - `addOpenAI()` prompts for API key on first run
