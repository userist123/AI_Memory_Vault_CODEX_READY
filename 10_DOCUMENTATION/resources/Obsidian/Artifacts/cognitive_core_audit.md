# Artifact: cognitive_core_audit

# Cognitive Core Infrastructure Audit

This audit evaluates the Phase 1 implementation of the Cognitive Core to determine the requirements for transitioning it into a persistent, autonomous cognitive system.

## 1. Architecture Findings
- **Executive**: Acts as the central OODA loop orchestrator. Synchronously calls Retrieve -> Attend -> Plan -> Act -> Reflect.
- **Working Memory**: A capacity-bounded (10 nodes) RAM buffer. Uses an `AttentionModel` (which tracks recency via a `tick` clock and initial activation) to evict the lowest-scoring nodes.
- **Activation Engine**: Evaluates `relations` recursively up to a depth of 3 and a max node limit of 20. It safely queries the `MemoryController`, meaning it inherits all P0 security, pagination, and Context Economy limits.
- **Synaptic Graph**: Entirely ephemeral. It extracts edges directly from `relations` in standard canonical Memory Objects on-the-fly. No duplicate graph database exists, preventing consistency drifts.
- **Planner & Reasoning**: Currently ephemeral prototypes. The Planner maps intents to a single-step action sequence. ReasoningEngine runs read-only logic.
- **Reflection**: Reacts to `ApprovalRequiredError` or execution failures by generating new Memory Objects (type `lesson` or `error`) and proposes them to the `MemoryController` under the `REVIEW` lifecycle with `inference` provenance.
- **Tool Router**: Enforces the Autonomy Policy using a default-deny (fail-closed) mapping. Unknown actions are treated as `HIGH` risk and blocked.

## 2. Persistence Boundary Map

### A. PERSISTENT STATE
- Canonical Memory Objects (managed by `FileStorageEngine`).
- Audit logs (managed by `MemoryController`).
- Generated Reflections (persisted as canonical notes by the `propose` API).

### B. SESSION STATE (Requires Survival Across Restarts)
- **Working Memory Buffer**: Currently lives strictly in RAM. If the process crashes, the AI loses its entire train of thought.
- **Active Plan**: Currently ephemeral. Multi-step execution is impossible across restarts.
- **Executive Clock (`tick`)**: Currently resets to 0, which would mess up recency scoring in Attention if WM is reloaded.

### C. EPHEMERAL STATE (Must NOT be Persisted)
- **Spreading Activation Queue**: The BFS queue and temporary node scores should evaporate. Activation should always be recomputed based on current canonical state.
- **Graph Edges (Synapses)**: Must remain dynamically extracted. Caching them on disk would violate the single-source-of-truth.
- **Intermediate Reasoner Syntheses**: Scratchpad thoughts during planning do not need persistence unless explicitly converted into a memory decision.

## 3. Critical Gaps
1. **Total Amnesia on Crash**: Because Working Memory and the current Active Plan exist only in RAM, a process crash or restart completely resets the agent's context.
2. **Synchronous Execution Loop**: The current `Executive` loop completes in a single synchronous pass. It cannot execute Step 1 of a plan, go to sleep, wake up on an event, and execute Step 2.
3. **No State Recovery**: There is no mechanism to serialize or deserialize the `WorkingMemory` buffer to disk.

## 4. Security Risks
- **Reflection Drift**: The `ReflectionPipeline` generates notes with provenance `inference`. While safe because it uses `REVIEW` lifecycle, an excessive loop of failures could spam the Vault with hundreds of `error` notes, consuming context budgets.
- **Safety Boundary**: The `ToolRouter` is robust (fail-closed). However, the `ReasoningEngine` does not currently sandbox LLM prompts (placeholder logic), which will be a factor when real generation is added.

## 5. Recovery Risks
- **Partial Execution**: If the system crashes after `router.execute()` mutates state but before `reflection.evaluate_outcome()` logs the result, the system wakes up unaware of what it just did.
- **State Inconsistencies**: Loading an active plan without restoring the exact Working Memory context that justified the plan could lead to hallucinated actions.

## 6. Missing Tests
- `test_recovery_working_memory`: Asserting that WM can be dumped to disk and reloaded with exact attention scores/ticks.
- `test_recovery_executive`: Asserting that an interrupted multi-step plan can resume from step 2.
- `test_concurrency_race`: Asserting that simultaneous MemoryController updates don't corrupt the ephemeral Synaptic Graph traversal.
- `test_reflection_flood`: Asserting limits on how many lessons/errors the reflection engine can spam in a single loop.

## 7. Minimal Implementation Plan for Phase 2 (Cognitive Continuity)

To achieve true autonomy, the Cognitive Core must survive restarts and handle multi-step plans.

**Proposed Next Steps:**
1. **BRAIN-7: Persistent Working Memory**
   - Introduce a state file (e.g., `C:\Users\Marius\.gemini\antigravity\brain\...\active_context.json` or within `04_MEMORY/`) to serialize `WorkingMemory` (node IDs, activation, attention, tick).
   - Implement `save_state()` and `load_state()` in `WorkingMemory`.
2. **BRAIN-8: Persistent Task Tracker**
   - Upgrade `Planner` to output a stateful plan object.
   - Serialize active plans so `Executive` can resume them.
3. **BRAIN-9: Loop Continuity**
   - Modify `Executive` to separate intent processing from plan execution, allowing it to poll for next steps independently of user prompts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **User Review Required**
> Do you approve this read-only audit? Should I proceed with the implementation plan for Phase 2 (BRAIN-7 to BRAIN-9), or would you like adjustments to the persistent vs ephemeral boundaries?
