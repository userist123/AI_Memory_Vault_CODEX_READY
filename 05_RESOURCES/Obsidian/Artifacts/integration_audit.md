## 3. Missing Connections (14 Critical Gaps)

### GAP-1: RecallEngine is orphaned
[recall.py](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/cognitive_core/recall.py) exists but is never instantiated or called by `Executive`. The Executive uses `ActivationEngine.activate_from_query()` directly and never applies RecallEngine's multi-signal scoring.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> RecallEngine was designed to combine semantic similarity, activation, confidence, and WM relevance. None of these signals currently influence retrieval beyond ActivationEngine's rank-order decay.

### GAP-2: Consolidator is orphaned
[consolidation.py](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/cognitive_core/consolidation.py) exists but is never triggered by the cognitive loop. There is no periodic trigger, no post-task hook, and no Executive call.

### GAP-3: Deduplicator is orphaned
[deduplication.py](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/cognitive_core/deduplication.py) exists but is never triggered.

### GAP-4: LearningEngine is orphaned
[learning.py](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/cognitive_core/learning.py) exists but is never triggered. A learned confidence promotion can never influence a future recall because it is never executed.

### GAP-5: Dynamic Synapses never fire
`ReflectionPipeline.propose_synapse()` exists but `evaluate_outcome()` never calls it. The only callers are unit tests. **No new graph edges are ever created autonomously.**

### GAP-6: RecallEngine doesn't use ActivationEngine output
RecallEngine expects `candidate_nodes` with `_temp_activation` but ActivationEngine returns `(node, activation)` tuples. The two components use incompatible data formats and are never composed.

### GAP-7: Consolidator/LearningEngine/Deduplicator bypass ToolRouter
All three call `MemoryController` directly, bypassing:
- BRAIN-13 reconciliation boundary
- Autonomy policy risk checks
- Any future ToolRouter extensions

This means Consolidator could archive a human-verified memory if called directly.

### GAP-8: Consolidator archive signature mismatch
`Consolidator.consolidate_lessons()` at [line 75](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/cognitive_core/consolidation.py#L75) calls:
```python
self.controller.archive(principal, lesson["id"])
```
But `MemoryController.archive()` requires **3 arguments**: `(principal, note_id, reason)`.
**This will crash at runtime.**

### GAP-9: Planner produces only single-step plans
[planning.py](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/cognitive_core/planning.py#L53-L64) always creates a 1-step plan with a fixed `search` action. Multi-step task execution is structurally supported by `ActivePlan` but functionally impossible because the Planner never generates multi-step plans from context.

### GAP-10: Failed tasks cannot be replanned
When `step_loop()` encounters an error or block, it returns the result but does **not**:
- Re-invoke the Planner
- Create an alternative plan
- Retry with different parameters
The Executive simply stops.

### GAP-11: Reflection memories are unreachable
`ReflectionPipeline.propose()` creates notes with `lifecycle=REVIEW`. But `MemoryController.read()` only returns `ACTIVE` notes. And `search()` excludes `RAW` notes but the retrieval engine filtering behavior for `REVIEW` notes depends on the storage engine. **A reflected lesson can never be recalled by ActivationEngine** unless it is manually promoted to ACTIVE.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is the single most critical gap. The learning loop is broken: the system can reflect and produce lessons, but those lessons are permanently invisible to future cognitive operations.

### GAP-12: No crash-before-checkpoint protection
`Executive.step_loop()` executes the action at [line 73](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/cognitive_core/executive.py#L73), then calls `complete_current_step()` at [line 80](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/cognitive_core/executive.py#L80), but `save_state()` is **never called automatically**. If the process crashes between action execution and the next explicit `save_state()` call, the step completion is lost. On restart, the step will be re-executed (non-idempotent).

### GAP-13: Duplicate Lifecycle enum definitions
`Lifecycle` is defined in **both**:
- [controller.py L53-L61](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/memory_controller/controller.py#L53-L61)
- [core.py L23-L31](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/memory_controller/core.py#L23-L31)

The Cognitive Core imports from `memory_controller.core.Lifecycle`. Some modules import from `memory_controller.controller.Lifecycle`. These are separate classes that happen to have the same values. Cross-module comparisons may fail unexpectedly.

### GAP-14: Duplicate StorageEngine definitions
`StorageEngine` is defined in both [controller.py L30-L51](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/memory_controller/controller.py#L30-L51) and [core.py L10-L21](file:///c:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_VAULT_CODEX_READY/memory_controller/core.py#L10-L21). The production singleton uses the one from `controller.py`. `core.py` is a dead duplicate.

## 4. Failure/Recovery Analysis

### Question-by-Question Answers

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Are all components actually connected? | **NO.** 5 modules are orphaned (RecallEngine, Consolidator, Deduplicator, LearningEngine, propose_synapse). |
| 2 | Are any components implemented but never invoked? | **YES.** All 5 listed above. |
| 3 | Are there duplicate sources of truth? | **YES.** `Lifecycle` enum (2 copies), `StorageEngine` class (2 copies), `MemoryController` class (2 copies in core.py vs controller.py). |
| 4 | Can a learned memory influence a future task? | **NO.** Reflected memories are created with `lifecycle=REVIEW` and cannot be read/searched by the cognitive loop. |
| 5 | Can Reflection produce a memory that later becomes retrievable? | **NO.** Not without manual human promotion to ACTIVE. |
| 6 | Can a failed task be replanned? | **NO.** Executive returns the error and stops. No re-planning logic exists. |
| 7 | Can a task survive a process restart? | **PARTIALLY.** `save_state()`/`load_state()` work correctly when called, but they are never called automatically. |
| 8 | Can WorkingMemory be restored correctly? | **YES** — if `save_state()` was called before the crash. Node rehydration via `MemoryController.read()` works. |
| 9 | Can TaskTracker resume the correct step? | **YES** — if `save_state()` was called. `ActivePlan.current_step_index` is persisted. |
| 10 | Does RecallEngine actually use SynapticGraph and activation? | **NO.** RecallEngine is never invoked. It reads `_temp_activation` from nodes but ActivationEngine stores activation externally. |
| 11 | Does LearningEngine actually influence future recall? | **NO.** LearningEngine is never invoked. Even if called, it updates confidence on ACTIVE nodes, which would affect attention scoring — but only if the node is already in WorkingMemory. |
| 12 | Can Deduplication and Reconciliation safely coexist? | **PARTIALLY.** Deduplicator only proposes hypothesis nodes, never deletes. But it bypasses ToolRouter, so reconciliation boundary is not enforced. |
| 13 | Are human-verified memories protected end-to-end? | **NO.** Only through ToolRouter (BRAIN-13). Consolidator/LearningEngine/Deduplicator bypass ToolRouter and could modify verified nodes. |
| 14 | Are all cognitive operations still behind MemoryController? | **YES.** All components use MemoryController for storage. No direct filesystem access. |
| 15 | Are Context Economy limits respected everywhere? | **YES** — in MemoryController read/search paths. Cognitive Core modules don't apply additional budget checks beyond what MC enforces. |
| 16 | Are cache/security/audit guarantees preserved? | **YES.** All operations go through MC which enforces these. |
| 17 | Can the system execute a multi-step task without manual intervention? | **NO.** Planner always generates 1-step plans. |
| 18 | Crash after action but before checkpoint? | **DATA LOSS.** The action executes (e.g., propose creates a note) but step_index is not persisted. On restart, the step re-executes, potentially creating duplicate notes. |
| 19 | What if reflection fails? | **SILENT FAILURE.** Exception in `evaluate_outcome()` is not caught by `step_loop()`, so it propagates up and kills the loop iteration. |
| 20 | What if persistence fails? | **SILENT LOSS.** `save_state()` writes JSON files but does not verify them. Partial writes corrupt the checkpoint. |
| 21 | Learned memory conflicts with verified memory? | **UNHANDLED.** Learning engine could promote a conflicting node's confidence without checking for contradictions. No contradiction detection exists. |

## 5. End-to-End Integration Scenario

### Minimal scenario proving the complete learning loop:

```
SETUP:
  1. Create ACTIVE knowledge node K1 ("Docker uses port 2376")
  2. Create ACTIVE knowledge node K2 ("Kubernetes default namespace")
     with relation → K1

TASK:
  3. User sends intent: "How do Docker and Kubernetes interact?"

RECALL:
  4. Executive.process_intent()
  5. ActivationEngine searches → finds K1, K2
  6. SynapticGraph follows K2→K1 edge
  7. WorkingMemory admits both nodes

PLAN:
  8. Planner creates plan (currently 1-step search)

EXECUTE:
  9. ToolRouter.execute("search", ...) → success

FAILURE (simulated):
  10. Second step attempts "update" on a non-existent node → error

REFLECTION:
  11. ReflectionPipeline.evaluate_outcome() → creates error memory E1 (lifecycle=REVIEW)

LEARNING:
  12. [CURRENTLY BROKEN] E1 should be retrievable on next task
  13. [CURRENTLY BROKEN] Consolidator should synthesize E1 with other errors
  14. [CURRENTLY BROKEN] LearningEngine should promote frequently-linked nodes

PERSISTENCE:
  15. Executive.save_state() → wm.json + plan.json

RESTART:
  16. New Executive.load_state() → restores WM and plan index
  17. step_loop() resumes from correct step

RECALL LEARNED LESSON:
  18. [CURRENTLY BROKEN] New intent triggers search
  19. [CURRENTLY BROKEN] E1 appears in results because lifecycle=ACTIVE
  20. [CURRENTLY BROKEN] WorkingMemory contains the lesson
  21. [CURRENTLY BROKEN] Planner avoids the same mistake

CONTINUE TASK:
  22. [CURRENTLY BROKEN] Executive replans around the failure
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Steps 12-14 and 18-22 are broken because reflected memories never become ACTIVE and the Planner cannot replan.

---

## 6. Required Integration Tests

### Critical tests that must pass before Phase 4:

| # | Test | What it proves |
|---|------|----------------|
| IT-1 | `test_reflection_memory_becomes_retrievable` | A lesson created by Reflection can be promoted and then found by ActivationEngine |
| IT-2 | `test_learned_lesson_influences_future_recall` | A promoted lesson appears in WorkingMemory during a related future task |
| IT-3 | `test_multi_step_plan_execution` | Planner generates >1 step and Executive completes all steps sequentially |
| IT-4 | `test_failure_triggers_replan` | An error causes the Executive to create a new plan and retry |
| IT-5 | `test_crash_recovery_idempotent` | After crash-restart, no duplicate notes are created |
| IT-6 | `test_auto_checkpoint_after_step` | `save_state()` is called automatically after each step completion |
| IT-7 | `test_consolidator_through_toolrouter` | Consolidator operates through ToolRouter, not directly on MC |
| IT-8 | `test_reconciliation_protects_verified_end_to_end` | No cognitive module can modify a verified memory without approval |
| IT-9 | `test_recall_engine_integrated_with_activation` | RecallEngine receives activation scores from ActivationEngine |
| IT-10 | `test_dynamic_synapses_fire_on_success` | Successful task completion creates new graph edges |
| IT-11 | `test_deduplication_runs_post_consolidation` | After consolidation, deduplication scans for new duplicates |
| IT-12 | `test_learning_engine_runs_periodically` | LearningEngine promotes memories that meet threshold |

---

## 7. Phase 4 Readiness Assessment

### Verdict: **NOT READY**

The system has strong foundations but the cognitive loop is **structurally incomplete**. The individual components are well-implemented and well-tested in isolation, but they are not connected into a functioning whole.

### Blocking Issues (must fix before Phase 4):

| Priority | Issue | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **P0** | GAP-11: Reflected memories unreachable | Learning loop is completely broken |
| **P0** | GAP-8: Consolidator archive signature mismatch | Runtime crash |
| **P0** | GAP-7: Phase 3 modules bypass ToolRouter | Reconciliation boundary violated |
| **P1** | GAP-1,2,3,4,5: Five modules orphaned | 40% of cognitive capability unused |
| **P1** | GAP-10: No replanning on failure | System cannot recover from errors |
| **P1** | GAP-12: No automatic checkpointing | Crash consistency not guaranteed |
| **P1** | GAP-9: Planner always generates 1-step | Multi-step tasks impossible |
| **P2** | GAP-13,14: Duplicate class definitions | Potential cross-module comparison bugs |
| **P2** | GAP-6: Data format incompatibility | RecallEngine/ActivationEngine can't compose |

### What works well:
- MemoryController is solid with full audit, security, cache, and context economy
- WorkingMemory persistence and rehydration works correctly
- ActivePlan persistence works correctly
- ToolRouter risk policy and BRAIN-13 reconciliation work
- ActivationEngine BFS traversal with SynapticGraph works
- Individual Phase 3 modules are correctly implemented in isolation
- 126/126 tests pass

---

## 8. Minimal Phase 4 Implementation Plan

### Phase 4: Integration Wiring

The goal is NOT new features. The goal is to **connect what exists**.

#### WIRE-1: Fix the learning loop (fixes GAP-11)
- After `ReflectionPipeline.propose()`, auto-promote the created note through `REVIEW → ACTIVE` lifecycle (or at minimum make REVIEW notes visible to search).
- Alternatively: allow ActivationEngine to retrieve REVIEW-lifecycle notes for cognitive operations.
- **Decision needed:** Should reflected memories auto-promote, or should search include REVIEW notes?

#### WIRE-2: Wire Phase 3 modules into Executive (fixes GAP-1,2,3,4,5)
- Executive constructor creates: RecallEngine, Consolidator, Deduplicator, LearningEngine.
- After `step_loop()` completes successfully, call propose_synapse for co-activated nodes.
- After all plan steps complete, trigger: Consolidator → Deduplicator → LearningEngine.
- RecallEngine replaces or augments ActivationEngine for initial retrieval.

#### WIRE-3: Route all writes through ToolRouter (fixes GAP-7)
- Consolidator, LearningEngine, Deduplicator must call `ToolRouter.execute()` instead of `MemoryController` directly.

#### WIRE-4: Fix Consolidator archive call (fixes GAP-8)
- Change `self.controller.archive(principal, lesson["id"])` to include `reason` parameter.

#### WIRE-5: Automatic checkpointing (fixes GAP-12)
- Call `save_state()` after each `complete_current_step()` in `step_loop()`.
- Add write verification (read-back JSON after write).

#### WIRE-6: Error recovery and replanning (fixes GAP-10)
- On error/block in `step_loop()`, invoke `Planner.create_plan()` with updated context.
- Limit retry count to prevent infinite loops.

#### WIRE-7: Multi-step plan generation (fixes GAP-9)
- Enhance `Planner.create_plan()` to decompose goals into multiple sub-steps based on context.

#### WIRE-8: Deduplicate Lifecycle/StorageEngine (fixes GAP-13,14)
- Delete `core.py` duplicate definitions or make them import from `controller.py`.
- Ensure all imports use the canonical `memory_controller.controller.Lifecycle`.

#### WIRE-9: Harmonize RecallEngine/ActivationEngine data format (fixes GAP-6)
- RecallEngine should accept `(node, activation)` tuples from ActivationEngine directly instead of expecting `_temp_activation` in the node dict.

### Recommended execution order:
```
WIRE-4  (bug fix, 1 line)
WIRE-8  (cleanup, low risk)
WIRE-3  (security fix)
WIRE-1  (unblocks learning loop)
WIRE-5  (crash safety)
WIRE-9  (data format)
WIRE-2  (main integration)
WIRE-6  (error recovery)
WIRE-7  (multi-step planning)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After WIRE-2, all 12 integration tests from Section 6 must pass before any further work.
