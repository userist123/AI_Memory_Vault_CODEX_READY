  authority: OWNER
  scope: "Continue PR #231 exclusively on codex/runtime-memory-pilot-20261008 for finalization, testing, and review of this pilot."
  main_only_derogation: LIMITED
  constraints:
    - "Does not change global MAIN_ONLY."
    - "Does not permit creation of other branches."
    - "Does not authorize merge, auto-merge, or GitHub administrative changes."
    - "Does not permit bypass of protected core or security limits."
    - "Does not cancel SEQUENTIAL_HANDOFF."
    - "Is not retroactive approval of prior actions."
  chronology: "This authorization applies from the timestamp above; prior actions remain governed by their prior authority state."
active_work:
  - operational Memory Vault pilot: VaultAccess bootstrap -> bounded MemoryController context -> execution contract -> action gate -> verification
  - pilot evidence classification remains CODE_INSPECTED / CONTRACT_TESTED / LIVE_VERIFIED / NOT_VERIFIED / BLOCKED
  - repository remediation, security hardening and structural rebuild on main
  - bounded terminal resolution contract and deterministic MVE calibration
  - single-main sequential execution
recent_state:
  - cognitive-memory target model V2 defines a bounded resolution pipeline with terminal response boundary
  - bounded terminal resolution is executable in the Planning Influence MVE
  - 06_INBOX is now explicitly local-only by contract; operational content is excluded from Git
  - one pending memory proposal was moved to 07_EVALUATION/historical_runs before removing it from the inbox
  - .gitignore now blocks operational inbox content and common local secret/runtime artifacts
  - raw PDF books were removed from the public operational inbox; their original paths remain observable in Git history
  - workflow process-raw-books.yml was removed because it depended on versioned raw inbox data and would bypass the local-only boundary
  - .env.example contains placeholders only
  - .gitleaks.toml and a fail-closed staged pre-commit hook were added
  - secret-scan.yml runs Gitleaks on push/pull_request/manual dispatch using pinned action commit and Gitleaks 8.30.1
  - redacted R001 secret incident inventory records ten reported credential categories as PENDING until external rotation/revocation evidence exists
  - history rewrite procedure exists but remains PENDING_OWNER_APPROVAL; no force-push performed
  - repository hygiene validator and regression tests were added; local reconstructed execution passed 4/4 tests
  - strict hygiene CI workflow was added, but CI runtime has not yet been verified
open_requirements:
  - verify PR #231 acceptance tests with fresh CI stdout/log evidence for final HEAD bcfba0ce2121df96333d55b750e0816f369c610d3
  - execute one real external client/runtime pilot and record LIVE_VERIFIED only if the client actually receives the bootstrap/context pack
  - run the controlled memory on/off comparison with the same task and predeclared rubric; otherwise keep INSUFFICIENT_DATA
  - finish metadata-driven cleanup of remaining 06_INBOX/RAW_IMPORTS nested tracked files
  - verify secret-scanning and hygiene CI runs with exact stdout/log evidence
  - audit all existing numbered roots and create exact before/after structural map
  - migrate production code and tests incrementally into 03_IMPLEMENTATION and 20_TESTS, updating imports/workflows
  - eliminate compatibility paths only after tests prove the migration safe
  - implement retrieval candidate fusion/rerank/observability requirements where currently absent
  - verify temporal/lifecycle/trust/learning E2E gates and structured traces
  - execute Planning Influence MVE tests against exact current main source and capture stdout/stderr
  - only then consider reusable cognitive_core integration of terminal resolution
blockers:
  - external credential rotation/revocation is outside repository access and still lacks owner evidence
  - local environment cannot clone GitHub directly
  - repository contains a large pre-existing raw-inbox subtree that requires metadata-driven file-by-file removal with the available GitHub write interface
  - CI runners may remain queued/unavailable; no CI result will be claimed without logs
  - no force-push/history rewrite without owner approval
next_actions:
  - enumerate and remove remaining tracked files under 06_INBOX/RAW_IMPORTS
  - inspect and harden workflow paths affected by the inbox change
  - create the 00-99 structural migration inventory before moving production code
  - run exact MVE and hygiene tests on the latest main source
  - preserve one reversible, evidence-backed change set at a time
