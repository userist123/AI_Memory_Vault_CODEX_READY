# Open PRs: make every PR functional (2026-10-07)

Baseline: `main` @ `609b01bf`, full suite 2611 passed / 13 skipped / 9 xfailed (local, 21 min).
Execution is delegated to Sonnet 5.5 agents, one PR (or stacked pair) each, pushing
ordinary commits to the PR's own head branch (no rebase, no force-push, no merge to main).

## Cross-PR constraint
- [x] `.gitleaks.toml`: everyone keeps the `[[allowlists]]` format. #209 must not
      reintroduce the legacy `[allowlist]` table (gitleaks rejects a file with both).

## Per PR
- [x] #203 Casa3D memory: fix 7 schema violations in `Casa3D.md` (UUID id, top-level
      confidence/verification, source_type, relation `target_id`, drop `review_note`);
      move ledgers from `03_IMPLEMENTATION/projects/` to `02_PRODUCT/projects/Casa3D/`.
- [x] #215 deps audit: update PR body (mongodb 4→6, next-intl 0→4, site build fix),
      reword "never runs project code" (`dotnet restore` runs MSBuild), fix the 13
      trading-journal type errors.
- [x] #214 vault:// routes: cut the ~28 s first call (CSafeLoader, parse frontmatter
      once, warm-up at server start); test the VAULT_STATE route count.
- [x] #211 + #213 routing: fix `adapter_ref` → program name (one shared resolver, test
      against the real `04_CONFIG/agent_router.json`); single output dir for
      route.json/result.json; restore CLAUDE.md sections dropped by the rewrite
      (Protected Core, Production-Consumer rule, provenance/safety) + contract test;
      enforce `min_ttl_seconds`; VAULT_STATE row "not wired"; then #213 → #211.
- [x] #209 security audit: `.gitleaks.toml` back to `[[allowlists]]`; restore
      CLAUDE.md quarantine contract (REVIEW readable, marked unverified) in
      `memory_access.py` / `pack_builder.py` + tests on non-verified fixtures; fix
      REST approve→promote; reviewer gate not self-declared; auth token in
      `vault_client.js`; skill import fails closed; honest PR body (unwired findings).
- [x] #207 owner-authority hook: truly fail-closed (try/except → deny, `|| exit 2`
      in settings), protocol stops claiming expiry/authentication it lacks, PR body.
      Gating policy (blocks Bash/Edit/Write without a broker) = owner decision.
- [x] #212 LogAnalyzer: guard `RawRegistry` subkey recursion (visited set + depth)
      + crafted-hive regression test; regex match timeouts in SigmaLite/YaraLite;
      malformed-input smoke tests for CFB/LNK/USN/JumpList/pcapng; PR body; CURRENT.md.
- [x] #206 Book-to-Memory: remove hardcoded HMAC fallback; drop `UNVERIFIED`
      lifecycle state / schema widening the policy doesn't know; ablation must not
      score "with note" higher without data; stop injecting sentences into note
      bodies (revert the 9 notes); PR body.

## Owner decisions (cannot be made by an agent)
- #207: should the hook block every mutating tool before an approval broker exists?
- #207: agents push with the owner's token, so GitHub cannot tell owner from agent.
- #206: keep as one research PR or split into docs / notes / edges / code.

## Review
(2026-10-07, after execution. Local full suite at 0 failures on every head except #215, whose 4 local failures came from node_modules/.next left in the worktree; those 4 files pass once removed, the full suite was not re-run there, CI is green.)

| PR | Head | CI | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #203 Casa3D | d6d8dcc2 | green | **merged by owner** |
| #215 deps audit | 612c3686 | green | ready; Polar SDK 0.22→0.49 + persisted `autopilot` plan need owner check |
| #214 vault:// routes | 71432c2b | green | ready; first call 15 s → 5.6–8.8 s (0.2 s once warm) |
| #212 LogAnalyzer | 3a8aa80a | green (Windows build 252/120) | ready; corpus run + page smoke test on Windows still owner-side |
| #209 security audit | 73528a22 | green 34/35 (CodeQL neutral) | ready; memory probe 48/48 (main 38/48, before fix 2/48) |
| #213 → #211 routing | 917ac413 | #213 green 12/12 | #211 turns green only once #213 lands in its branch (push was refused by the permission guard; owner merges #213) |
| #207 owner guardrail | 0714656c | green | functional; **merging blocks most agent tools until a broker exists** |
| #206 Book-to-Memory | 2fe1b674 | green | research-only; split recommended |

Every PR still open merges cleanly with main after #203 (trial merge + state test).

Owner decisions collected from the agents:
- #207: block before a broker exists? separate bot identity for agents; configure-script side effects.
- #206: split into docs / notes / edge verdicts / code; accept the 9 restored notes as listed islands.
- #209: keep serving never-stamped REVIEW notes flagged unverified; trim ~1k lines of PR209 docs; wire the runtime-authority layer (separate PR).
- #212: Sigma stops a rule after its first timeout; YARA 10 s limit vs large files.
- #215: test Polar checkout in a sandbox.
- Suggested merge order: #215 → #214 → #212 → #209 → #213→#211 → #207 → #206.

## Merge round (2026-10-08)
Merged to main in order, each after green CI on main + PR: #209 (`e98ab626`, plus a 401 fix for
non-ASCII auth headers), #215 (`c19fd5b6`), #214 (`0e7d7857`), #212 (`f8dc8a31`), #213 into #211, #211
(`1e2f6a0d`, plus cryptography 50.0.2 and the MCP-surface test fix that #209+#214 broke on main).
main @ `1e2f6a0d`: security/tests 204 passed; full suite 2912 passed / 13 skipped / 9 xfailed.
Waiting on owner: #207 (blocks agent tools once merged), #206 (split recommended).

## NEXT PROJECT (queued 2026-10-08) — LogAnalyzer contract audit
Start only after the Book-to-Memory blocker PRs are merged and no PR is open.
Stage 1 is an audit, **no code changes**:
- [x] Read, in order: `02_PRODUCT/projects/workspaces/loganalyzer-dfir/docs/dfir/LOGANALYZER_PROGRAM_REQUIREMENTS.md` (functional/architectural
      contract), then `02_PRODUCT/projects/workspaces/loganalyzer-dfir/docs/dfir/LOGANALYZER_PRODUCT_UX_CONTRACT.md` (how capabilities are shown).
- [x] **Do not redo existing research or audits** (owner, 2026-10-08). Start from what exists and only
      fill the gaps: `loganalyzer-dfir/docs/dfir/REALITY_AUDIT.md`, `DFIR_CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md`,
      `RESEARCH_AND_ROADMAP.md`, the other `docs/dfir/*.md` contracts, `Documentation/PHASE1-STATUS.md`,
      `00_GOVERNANCE/coordination/projects/LOGANALYZER_DFIR/CURRENT.md`, and
      `02_PRODUCT/projects/workspaces/loganalyzer-dfir/docs/dfir/PR212_RESEARCH_2026-10-07.md`. Reuse their findings; re-check a finding
      only where the code changed after it was written (#212 merged 2026-10-08).
- [x] **Freshness rule** (owner, 2026-10-08): reuse an existing audit only if it is close to current
      main. Measured on main @ a6c6d7aa (LogAnalyzer code commits made after the doc was last updated):
      | Doc | Last update | Code commits since | Use |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | `CURRENT.md` (coordination) | 2026-10-07 | 0 | reuse |
      | `docs/dfir/RESEARCH_AND_ROADMAP.md` | 2026-10-07 | 2 | reuse, re-check the 2 commits |
      | `docs/dfir/REALITY_AUDIT.md` | 2026-10-07 | 3 | reuse, re-check the 3 commits |
      | `02_PRODUCT/projects/workspaces/loganalyzer-dfir/docs/dfir/PR212_RESEARCH_2026-10-07.md` | 2026-10-07 | fixes landed after it | reuse; its 6 fix items are done |
      | `docs/dfir/DFIR_CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` | 2026-10-04 | 54 | **stale**: re-audit the areas it covers |
      | `Documentation/PHASE1-STATUS.md` | 2026-09-16 | 56 | **stale**: historical only, do not rely on it |
      Re-measure these numbers when the audit actually starts (main will have moved).
- [x] Map the two contracts onto those findings; audit only the requirements they do not cover, and
      audit `main` (`02_PRODUCT/projects/workspaces/loganalyzer-dfir/`) for those, classifying each requirement and
      classify each as IMPLEMENTED / PARTIAL / MISSING / UNWIRED, with file:line evidence and the
      production consumer (or its absence) for each.
- [x] Rules from the owner: existing functionality is not refactored or removed just to build the UI;
      a facade without a real consumer is never presented as production-ready.
- [x] Deliver the classified list for owner review before any AI is allowed to modify code.
      → `02_PRODUCT/projects/workspaces/loganalyzer-dfir/docs/dfir/CONTRACT_AUDIT_STAGE1.md` (main @ 0689f5d4, 2026-10-08). Requirements: 194 rows,
      53 IMPLEMENTED / 94 PARTIAL / 6 UNWIRED (27 components) / 41 MISSING. UX: 35 rows, 0 / 23 / 0 / 12.
      Spot-checked by the orchestrator: static "ALL SYSTEMS NORMAL"/"SHIELD ARMED" text, `ComplianceAuditEngine`
      CONFORM lines 52/75 unconditional, `Finding.ContradictingEvidence` declared and never set.
- [x] Owner: answer the 12 questions in §6 (2026-10-08: all 12 final) → audit §8.
- [ ] Owner: explicit go for stage 2 (WP0 first, then WP1 ∥ WP12).

## STAGE 2 — LogAnalyzer (started 2026-10-08, owner "start etapa 2")
Spec: `02_PRODUCT/projects/workspaces/loganalyzer-dfir/docs/dfir/CONTRACT_AUDIT_STAGE1.md` §7 (WP order) + §8 (12 final owner decisions).
- [x] WP0 baseline & governance (#227, merged a082dfca) (PR `loganalyzer/wp0-baseline`): CUR update, audit + contracts copied to docs/dfir, historical banners, Windows CI baseline.
- [x] WP1 honest shell (#228, merged 1ad7882a) (PR `loganalyzer/wp1-honest-shell`): static safety text, CONFORM without evidence → not assessed, APT page renamed, test-alert label, unwired facades marked.
- [x] WP12 tests & release gate (#229, merged 94020777) (PR `loganalyzer/wp12-release-gate`): synthetic corpus in CI, gate script + CI job (report on PRs, enforce on release), waiver format, CodeQL C#, PR212 #3/#4.
- [x] Review each PR: Windows CI green, local tests vs main, production-consumer grep; then merge in order WP0 → WP1/WP12.
- [ ] In progress (2026-10-08): WP-ED → WP-PKG (one agent, two PRs) ∥ WP2 (separate agent). Then WP3, WP4.

## Security fixes found by the accreditation analysis (confirmed by orchestrator, 2026-10-08)
- [ ] `LogAnalyzer.Infrastructure/Services/AuditCollectionService.cs:33` falls back to a developer path
      (`C:\Users\Marius\Desktop\LogAnalyzer.MVP\Scripts\AuditCollector.ps1`) and runs it with
      `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` (line 49); `AuditCollector.ps1` is not in the repo, so the feature is broken
      and any file at that path would run. Fix: drop the fallback, fail closed with a clear error, resolve the
      script only from the app's own signed install dir. Small PR after WP1 merges (avoid conflicts).
- [ ] Licensing: the key-derivation salt is in code (`LicenseService.cs`) and in `Generate-LicenseKey.ps1`, and
      `license.lic` is committed, so anyone with the repo can mint licences. Fix needs an owner decision:
      asymmetric signing (owner keeps the private key offline, app ships only the public key). Then rotate,
      remove the committed licence file from the tree.
      **Owner (2026-10-08): do it after the app is finished; orchestrator explains the procedure to the owner then.**
- [ ] Hardcoded demo identity "MARIUS-PC\Marius" in `ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs:645-659` (workspace-root legacy
      demo data): label as demo or drop from production views (decision 4: legacy root files untouched unless
      they present fake data as real → WP1 scope).

## Side deliverable — why a local admin should not collect/delete audit logs (owner request 2026-10-08)
Standalone document for the organisation, NOT tied to the app. Delivered to the owner as .docx only (not in the repo).
Basis: Legea 182/2002, HG 585/2002 (INFOSEC), ORNISS; NIS2 / 2024/2690 / OUG 155/2024 as recommendations.
Scope: systems with and without classified information (air-gapped networks, standalone PCs, connected for unclassified).
- [x] Draft with verbatim citations; delivered to the owner as .docx (2026-10-08).
- [x] Orchestrator re-fetched the sources: 57/57 HG 585 + Legea 182 quotes and 27/27 NIS2 + 2024/2690 quotes match; OUG quotes agent-verified only.

## App requirements — audit-data handling inside LogAnalyzer (owner, 2026-10-08)
Independent of the standalone audit-log document. Each item cites its provision once the
HG 585 accreditation analysis is verified.
- [ ] **Two applications (owner, 2026-10-08):**
      - **P1 — classified edition**: separate build/executable. Network, remote AI, host-modifying actions
        (containment, firewall, powershell/auditpol changes) and updates are NOT compiled in (absent, not disabled).
        Adds classification marking, INFOSEC roles, full user-action audit.
      - **P2/P3 — unclassified edition**: one executable, two modes chosen by signed policy at install and not
        downgradable by the operator: P2 air-gapped (network off), P3 connected (network on, secured: TLS,
        signed updates, AI endpoint policy). Keeps all existing functionality.
      - Shared core libraries (parsers, evidence, timeline, verification, custody) used by both; nothing duplicated.
      - New work package **WP-ED (edition split)** after WP0/WP1/WP12 merge and before WP3: inventory which
        assemblies carry network/host-modifying code, move them behind edition boundaries (no removal),
        two build outputs in CI, test that the P1 build contains none of the excluded code.
- [ ] **Self-contained, AI-independent (owner decision 14, 2026-10-08)** → **WP-PKG**, done with WP-ED:
      - Publish both editions self-contained (runtime + native libs bundled; existing
        `win-x64-singlefile.pubxml` already sets SelfContained/SingleFile/IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract —
        verify it builds the current solution and covers QuestPDF/SQLCipher natives).
      - CI job: publish, then run the published exe smoke test with no .NET on PATH/DOTNET_ROOT and no network;
        list every external process the app may start and check each exists on supported Windows versions.
      - Collection and interpretation fully deterministic without AI; a test runs the full pipeline with the AI
        layer absent and asserts identical findings.
      - Supported Windows (decision 15): Win 11 23H2/24H2/25H2, **Win 10 LTSC 2019/2021 (incl. IoT)**, Server 2022/2025
        fully; Server 2016/2019, Win 10 22H2, LTSB 2016 best effort. Fix list: `02_PRODUCT/projects/workspaces/loganalyzer-dfir/docs/dfir/WINDOWS_TOOLING_COMPAT.md`.
      - Never use wmic (owner rule); PowerShell 5.1 or in-process APIs. Replace or report tools that may be missing; `AuditCollector.ps1` must ship inside the
        package (today it is missing — see security fixes).
- [ ] WP3: case field "system category" (air-gapped network / standalone PC / connected × classified / unclassified)
      driving collection, export and retention rules.
- [ ] WP3: read-only collection + SHA-256 at acquisition; the app never deletes or clears logs on the source system.
- [ ] WP3: hash-chained custody records who collected, from which system, with which removable medium; warn when the
      collector is the audited system's own administrator.
- [ ] WP3: lifecycle states (decision 11); deletion only as a manual, dual-approved, logged mark with a legal-hold check.
- [ ] WP10: exports carry the case's classification marking, a hash manifest and the medium used.
- [ ] WP1→WP4: link the existing HG 585 checks in `ComplianceAuditEngine` to the cited articles; never "CONFORM" without evidence.
- [ ] WP10: "audit/compliance" report profile showing which provision each check rests on and what is missing.

## Accreditation readiness of the app itself (owner, 2026-10-08)
The owner will accredit LogAnalyzer to run on accredited internal SIC (classified) and on unclassified
air-gapped networks / standalone PCs. The app's own behaviour and documentation must satisfy HG 585/2002
(INFOSEC) + Legea 182/2002 (and NIS2 / 2024/2690 where unclassified).
**PARKED (owner, 2026-10-08): build the app first; accreditation comes after, with data the owner will supply.**
- [ ] Keep the requirements + gap analysis (`02_PRODUCT/projects/workspaces/loganalyzer-dfir/docs/dfir/HG585_ACCREDITATION_REQUIREMENTS.md`) and its quote
      sources on this branch for later. Do not start WP-ACR work until the owner returns with the accreditation data.

## Owner answers to mapping Q1–Q10 (2026-10-08) → audit §8 decisions 16–25
- Own media register in the app (registration number field, EPP-Basic style) → WP14.
- Users/roles + manually entered clearances, one global admin for now → WP14/WP13 + P1 roles.
- Procedure profile + zones entered manually with paste/import → WP15/WP14.
- Station/domain/e-mail stay under Advanced.
- Classification: NATO CTS/NS/NC/NR + EU TS/S/C/R UE + national HG 585 levels; no unclassified.
- Tier-3 importers only on demand; **printers now**: PaperCut-MF-style print tracking from PrintService/Operational 307/805 → new WP16a (print), Tier 1 for this owner. Case scope fields mandatory. WP1b approved. Exchange scripts not in P1.

## WP16a — Print tracking (decision 26)
- [ ] Owner to supply: 3–5 real document-name examples (pattern), printer models + driver type (PCL/PS/XPS, v3/v4),
      sample PrintService/Operational export, sample spool files (.SPL/.SHD) from a test printer, MFP logs per model.
- [ ] Job states incl. "nothing came out"; content capture from kept spool files (EMF/XPS → text/PDF), stored as
      classified case material; naming-standard check; chain print→scan→PDF→USB.

## EXECUTION QUEUE — "make the app ready" (owner, 2026-10-08)
One work package at a time (token rule), each = fresh agent from a short prompt + checkpoint file, PR, CI green
(Windows build + Python `enforce`), orchestrator verification (trial merge, both Python roots, .NET build), merge.
1. [ ] #235 notes/specs → main; #233 WP2 → main; WP-ED PR → main; WP-PKG PR → main (incl. AuditCollector.ps1, dev-path fix, no wmic, self-contained smoke test).
2. [ ] WP1b — log-clear lifecycle (routine vs unexpected), no after-hours auto-penalty, no "Conform" on absence.
3. [ ] WP3 — hash-chained case audit + custody, evidence lifecycle states (decision 11), mutation invalidation, case scope fields (decision 23).
4. [ ] WP4 — verification layer (separate assembly, verdicts, contradictions, gate for Vault export/report banner).
5. [ ] WP15 — procedure profile (hours, rotation, approved software, expected GPO, zones; manual + import), GPO/policy change timeline + diff, control gap, configured/applied/enforced/observed, log lifecycle, time manipulation.
6. [ ] WP14 + WP11 Tier 1 (WP11-T1 #245 and WP14a #246 merged; WP14b combined sequences next) — media register (registration no., decision 16), users/roles + clearances (decision 17), USB/CD-DVD/portable storage, NIC/Wi-Fi/BT on air-gapped hosts, zone transfers; SMB 5140/5145, 4663, accounts, RDP/WinRM, security agents.
6b. [x] WP-AUTH (#247, merged 2026-10-09; decision 34 recorded) — smart-card sign-in (decision 33): contact PKI card in the keyboard smart-card slot + PIN via SafeNet, primary admin may always use account + password, card→user mapping in the users register (WP14a), offline chain/CRL, sign-in audit chain, role gate for register/admin actions; spec `00_GOVERNANCE/coordination/tasks/todo-claude-wp-auth.md`.
7. [ ] WP5/WP6/WP7 — case persistence + Home + coverage matrix; RO/EN localisation, accessibility, finding card/Why/Evidence/Know-Think-Don't-know; goal-based navigation, Verify + Memory pages.
8. [ ] WP13 — Access Evidence + classification (NATO/EU/national, decision 21), mismatch, document lifecycle.
9. [ ] WP16a — print tracking (decision 26, PRINT_TRACKING_RESEARCH.md): job states, content capture EMF/XPS → text/PDF, naming check, device confirmation (P1 import / P2-P3 SNMP-IPP).
10. [ ] WP8 AI surface (P2/P3 only), WP9 response verification, WP10 report profiles + export manifest + classification marking.
11. [ ] WP17 baseline/bulk/staging; WP16 other imports on demand.
12. [ ] Licensing → asymmetric signatures (explain key handling to owner first); waiver + edition-policy public keys from owner.
Owner-supplied items that stay placeholders until provided: signing keys, MFP/printer samples, document-name examples.
