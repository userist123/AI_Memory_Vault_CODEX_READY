# Baseline reconciliation — Phase 0

Measured on 2026-09-20 against `origin/main` at `10224498c`. Every number here
comes from a command run on that SHA, in a clean worktree. Nothing is carried
over from an earlier audit.

## Git state

| | |
|---|---|
| `origin/main` | `10224498c` (Merge PR #174) |
| Local `main` | `3b2991344`, clean working tree, **2 commits behind**, 0 ahead |
| Remotes | one: `origin` → `github.com/userist123/AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY` |
| Active git hooks | none (only `.sample`) |
| Authors across all branches | `userist123`, `Marius`, `github-actions[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]` — no unknown author |
| Open PRs | #135 `r025/readme-rewrite`, #90 `r053-pm-phase7-risk-abstention` — both stale |

**D1 recommendation: fast-forward.** The working tree is clean and there is
nothing local to lose, so `git -C <repo> merge --ff-only origin/main` is enough.
A rebase, a fresh clone or a reset would all be more disruptive for no gain.
Risk: none beyond the two commits arriving, which are already on the remote.

## What landed since the last audit

`3b2991344` merged `antigravity/graph-and-core-real` straight into `main`
without a pull request, so no CI ran on the merge itself and no review happened.
It carries the graph work and `468fe9992`, the cognitive-module wiring. Both are
examined in `MODULE_REALITY_MATRIX.md`; the wiring broke `main` (see
`TEST_BASELINE.md`).

## Open worktrees on this machine

Fifteen, several of them stale (`C:/w/pr168`, `C:/w/readme`, `C:/w/vault-hygiene`
and others whose branches are merged). They cost nothing but make it easy to
measure the wrong tree. Cleaning them is a reversible chore, not an owner
decision.
