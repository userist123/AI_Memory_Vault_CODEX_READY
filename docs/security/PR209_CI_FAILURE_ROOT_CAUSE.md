## 1. CI Failure Diagnosis & Reproduction

During CI execution on commit `c3c1848cf`, two workflows failed while all 33 other workflows passed:
1. `enforce` (Run 37244799241, Job 111560450788)
2. `regression-and-heldout` (Run 37244799189, Job 111560496245)

Both failed on the exact same two tests out of 2,637 total collected tests.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis & Resolution Table

| Check | Step | Root Cause | Reproduction | Fix | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `enforce` / `regression-and-heldout` | `Run regression tests` (`test_memory_usage_report.py`) | In `20_TESTS/memory_vault_fixture.py`, `note_text()` parameter `verification` had been changed to default to `"verified"`. In `test_memory_usage_report.py`, the test performed `.replace("verification: unverified", f"verification: {verification}")`. Because the string already contained `"verification: verified"`, the replace did not match for `verification="unverified"`, causing both test proposals to be parsed as verified (`2/3` instead of expected `1/3`). | `pytest 20_TESTS/test_memory_usage_report.py` reproduced `AssertionError: assert '2/3' == '1/3'`. | Set default parameter in `note_text()` to `verification: str = "unverified"`. In `make_vault()`, explicitly pass `verification="verified"` when creating seed knowledge notes so canonical seed notes remain verified while test fixtures performing `.replace()` function identically. | `pytest 20_TESTS/test_memory_usage_report.py` passes 9/9 tests in 1.4s. |
| `enforce` / `regression-and-heldout` | `Run regression tests` (`test_ontology_slot_writers.py`) | `TestKnownWriters.test_no_unreviewed_writer` statically scans every Python file in the repository that references `ontology/slots` and performs file write operations (`.write_text()`). New negative test cases in `20_TESTS/test_memory_access.py` wrote temporary test notes to `vault/.../knowledge/` while referencing ontology slots. Because `20_TESTS/test_memory_access.py` was not in `ontology_slot_writers.json`, the scan flagged it as an unreviewed writer. | `pytest 20_TESTS/test_ontology_slot_writers.py` reproduced `Lists differ: ['20_TESTS/test_memory_access.py'] != []`. | Registered `20_TESTS/test_memory_access.py` in `20_TESTS/fixtures/ontology_slot_writers.json` with role `test`, gate `n/a (temporary directories)`, and reviewed disposition confirming it only writes into temporary vault directories in `tmp_path`. | `pytest 20_TESTS/test_ontology_slot_writers.py` passes 9/9 tests in 2.5s. |
