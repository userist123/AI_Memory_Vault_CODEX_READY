# PR #209 — Concrete Blockers Remediation & Regression Proof

**Branch**: `security/audit-remediation-2026-10`  
**Target**: `main`  
**PR**: #209 — `fix(security): close audit findings for runtime authority and memory integrity`  
**Status**: All 5 Blockers REMEDIATED & VERIFIED BY NEGATIVE REGRESSION TESTS  

---

## Executive Summary

Following independent code inspection, five concrete blockers were identified on PR #209 that prevented integration into `main`. This document presents the empirical proof of vulnerability reproduction, the architectural remediation applied, and the negative regression tests demonstrating that bypasses are closed.

| Blocker ID | Core Vulnerability | Pre-Fix Behavior | Remediated Enforcement | Test Proof | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B1** | Approval broker and owner authority instantiated in-process with fallback | In `production_mode=True`, missing broker generated in-process; test secrets accepted; agent had access to `.broker.issue_approval` | Mandatory externally-injected `ApprovalBroker` (secret $\ge 32$ chars, rejects `test-`/`dev-`) and `PersistentNonceStore`. `.broker` and `issue_approval` raise `PermissionError` in production. Added non-privileged `request_approval`. | `test_blocker1_*` (4 tests) | **VERIFIED_FIXED** |
| **B2** | Revision and content bindings omissible on mutating operations | Tokens could omit `revision_id` and `content_sha256`, enabling TOCTOU mutations without cryptographic content pinning | Enforced strict matching when token contains bindings; mandatory `revision_id` + `content_sha256` binding for all mutating tools and operations (`patch`, `update`, `state_mutate`, `delete`, `memory_patch`, `file_writer`, etc.). | `test_blocker2_mandatory_binding_for_mutating_tools` | **VERIFIED_FIXED** |
| **B3** | `memory_access.search()` reintroduces quarantined / unverified content | Fallback to `stored["content"]` when `readable` content was stripped by `cognitive_read` | `readable` is strictly authoritative for model disclosure under `Principal.AI_AGENT`. Quarantined/unverified notes have snippet `""`. Zero fallback to storage for `AI_AGENT`. `ma.get()` rejects quarantined notes. | `test_blocker3_*` & `test_quarantined_note_*` | **VERIFIED_FIXED** |
| **B4** | Persistent nonce store race conditions across processes | In-process `threading.Lock` vulnerable to multi-worker / multi-process replay; corrupted store behavior undefined | SQLite WAL mode with atomic `INSERT INTO consumed_identifiers` guarded by `PRIMARY KEY`. Fail-closed on corrupted DB or integrity error. Exactly 1 consumer succeeds across concurrent instances. | `test_blocker4_*` (2 tests) | **VERIFIED_FIXED** |
| **B5** | CI scanner failure masked as `EXECUTED_PASSED` | `.github/workflows/apisec-scan.yml` and `fortify.yml` checked `configured == 'true'` in `always()` step, reporting `EXECUTED_PASSED` even if scan failed | Steps assigned explicit IDs (`id: apisec_scan`, `id: fortify_scan`). Report step inspects step `outcome`: `outcome == 'success'` $\to$ `EXECUTED_PASSED`; non-success $\to$ `EXECUTED_FAILED`; unconfigured $\to$ `NOT_CONFIGURED_OPTIONAL`. | `test_blocker5_*` & `test_apisec_and_fortify_*` | **VERIFIED_FIXED** |

## Detailed Blockers Remediation & Verification

### Blocker 1 — Broker / Owner Authority External Separation

#### 1. Vulnerability Description
Prior to remediation, `RuntimeEnforcer` would implicitly construct an `ApprovalBroker` in-process with a default generated key if no broker was provided. In addition, `RuntimeAdapter` exposed `.broker` and `issue_approval()` directly on the adapter instance. In an agentic environment, an untrusted agent could invoke `adapter.broker.issue_approval(...)` or supply dev/test keys to grant itself execution rights.

#### 2. Architectural Remediation
- **`ApprovalBroker` Hardening**: Added `production_mode: bool = False`. When `production_mode=True`, secret must be at least 32 characters and cannot start with `test-` or `dev-`.
- **`RuntimeEnforcer` Strict Injection**:
  ```python
  if self.production_mode:
      if broker is None or not isinstance(broker, ApprovalBroker):
          raise PermissionError("Production runtime requires an explicitly injected ApprovalBroker")
      if broker._secret.startswith("test-") or broker._secret.startswith("dev-") or len(broker._secret) < 32:
          raise PermissionError("Production runtime rejects test or development approval secrets")
      if nonce_store is None:
          raise PermissionError("Production runtime requires an explicitly injected persistent nonce store")
  ```
- **Agent Least Privilege**: Access to `enforcer.broker` and `enforcer.issue_approval` in production mode raises `PermissionError("Approval issuance is not permitted in production mode; approvals must originate from external authority")`.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Agents are provided `request_approval(request) -> str` to generate structured JSON requests for external human/owner signing, with zero capability to self-sign.

#### 3. Empirical Test Proof
- `test_blocker1_production_runtime_requires_explicit_broker_and_nonce_store`: Confirms instantiating without broker or without persistent nonce store raises `PermissionError`.
- `test_blocker1_test_secret_rejected_in_production_mode`: Confirms secrets starting with `test-` or shorter than 32 chars raise `PermissionError`.
- `test_blocker1_agent_secret_cannot_authorize_production_operation`: Confirms an agent attempting to sign with its own key is rejected (`approval_unauthenticated`).
- `test_blocker1_agent_cannot_access_broker_or_issue_approval_in_production`: Confirms calling `.broker` or `issue_approval()` raises `PermissionError`.

### Blocker 2 — Revision & Content Binding Enforcement

#### 1. Vulnerability Description
`ApprovalToken` could omit `revision_id` and `content_sha256`. When omitted, `RuntimeEnforcer.authorize` did not verify whether the execution request targeted a specific state revision or content payload. This opened a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability where an approval for a generic update could be executed against modified files or state.

#### 2. Architectural Remediation
- **Strict Bidirectional Matching**:
  - If token specifies `revision_id`, request must specify `revision_id` and they must match exactly. Missing or mismatched revision returns `approval_revision_mismatch`.
  - If token specifies `content_sha256`, request must specify `content_sha256` and they must match exactly. Missing or mismatched hash returns `approval_content_mismatch`.
- **Mandatory Binding Policy for Mutating Operations**:
  - For operations in `{"patch", "update", "state_mutate", "delete"}` and tools in `{"memory_patch", "state_mutate", "file_writer", "code_patch"}`:
  - Both `approval.revision_id` and `approval.content_sha256` are mandatory. Omitting either returns `approval_binding_required_for_tool`.

#### 3. Empirical Test Proof
- `test_m01_b02_revision_binding_mismatch_rejected`: Confirms tampering with revision or content SHA256 yields denial.
- `test_blocker2_mandatory_binding_for_mutating_tools`: Confirms tokens omitting revision or content hash for mutating tools are rejected fail-closed with `approval_binding_required_for_tool`.

### Blocker 3 — Memory Access Snippet Disclosure & Quarantine Hardening

#### 1. Vulnerability Description
`03_IMPLEMENTATION/packages/interfaces/memory_access.py` fell back to `stored.get("content", "")` whenever `raw_snippet_text` was empty:
```python
raw_snippet_text = readable.get("content", "") if readable else ""
if not raw_snippet_text and stored:
    raw_snippet_text = stored.get("content", "")  # VULNERABILITY: bypassed cognitive quarantine!
```
If a note was unverified or quarantined and `cognitive_read` had scrubbed the content for `Principal.AI_AGENT`, reading directly from `stored` bypassed the security boundary and disclosed sensitive or untrusted payload bytes into search snippets.

#### 2. Architectural Remediation
- **Authoritative Model Disclosure**: `readable` (produced by `cognitive_read(Principal.AI_AGENT)`) is strictly authoritative for model egress.
- **Zero Fallback to Storage**: For `Principal.AI_AGENT`, `stored["content"]` is NEVER accessed to populate search snippets.
- **Quarantine Check**: If note is marked quarantined in `stored`, `item`, or `readable`, snippet is strictly `""`.
- **Get Refusal**: `memory_access.get()` explicitly refuses quarantined notes for `Principal.AI_AGENT` (`ValueError("Note ... is quarantined and cannot be retrieved")`).

#### 3. Empirical Test Proof
- `test_quarantined_note_has_empty_snippet_in_search_results`: Quarantined note with secret text returns `snippet == ""` in search results and raises `ValueError` on `ma.get()`.
- `test_unverified_redacted_note_does_not_leak_content_via_search_snippet`: Active unverified note stripped by cognitive read returns `snippet == ""` in search results.
- `test_blocker3_search_does_not_leak_quarantined_or_unverified_content_in_snippets`: Direct adversarial mock proving that non-empty `stored["content"]` is never leaked when `cognitive_read` redacts payload.

### Blocker 4 — Multi-Process Persistent Nonce Store Atomicity

#### 1. Vulnerability Description
Replay protection previously used in-process data structures (`_used_approvals: set`) or non-atomic SQLite transactions wrapped in `threading.Lock`. In multi-process or multi-worker deployments (e.g. gunicorn/uvicorn workers or CLI subagents), parallel processes could race to consume the same nonce, allowing concurrent execution of single-use approvals.

#### 2. Architectural Remediation
- **SQLite Engine Upgrade**: Configured SQLite WAL mode (`PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL`), `PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL`, and `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000`.
- **Atomic Database-Level Constraint**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS consumed_identifiers (
      identifier TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      consumed_at REAL NOT NULL
  )
  ```
- **Atomic Consumption**: Uses `INSERT INTO consumed_identifiers VALUES (?, ?)` inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. The uniqueness constraint is enforced by SQLite across all concurrent operating system processes.
- **Fail-Closed on Corruption**: If SQLite file is corrupted or unreadable, `PersistentNonceStore.check_and_mark()` catches exceptions and returns `False` (denying the operation rather than allowing unauthenticated replay).

#### 3. Empirical Test Proof
- `test_blocker4_sqlite_nonce_store_multi_instance_atomicity`: Concurrent thread/process pool with 8 workers across 2 independent `RuntimeEnforcer` instances sharing the SQLite file. Exactly 1 claim succeeds; exactly 7 claims fail with `approval_replayed`. Post-restart third instance also rejects replay.
- `test_blocker4_corrupted_nonce_store_fails_closed`: Writing garbage data to SQLite header causes subsequent `check_and_mark` calls to fail closed (returning `False`).

### Blocker 5 — CI Execution Status Verification

#### 1. Vulnerability Description
In `.github/workflows/apisec-scan.yml` and `.github/workflows/fortify.yml`:
The scan steps had no step IDs, and the final reporting step ran with `if: always()` and only checked:
```bash
if [[ "${{ steps.config.outputs.configured }}" == "true" ]]; then
  echo "APIsec execution status: EXECUTED_PASSED"
```
If the scanner exited with an error, crashed, or detected security flaws, the workflow still logged `EXECUTED_PASSED` simply because secrets were present.

#### 2. Architectural Remediation
- **Explicit Step IDs**: Added `id: apisec_scan`, `id: import_results`, and `id: fortify_scan`.
- **Outcome Inspection**: Updated reporting step shell script:
  ```bash
  if [[ "${{ steps.config.outputs.configured }}" == "true" ]]; then
    scan_outcome="${{ steps.apisec_scan.outcome }}"
    import_outcome="${{ steps.import_results.outcome }}"
    if [[ "$scan_outcome" == "success" && ( "$import_outcome" == "success" || "$import_outcome" == "skipped" ) ]]; then
      echo "APIsec execution status: EXECUTED_PASSED"
    else
      echo "APIsec execution status: EXECUTED_FAILED"
    fi
  else
    status="${{ steps.config.outputs.scan_status || 'NOT_CONFIGURED_OPTIONAL' }}"
    echo "APIsec execution status: $status"
  fi
  ```
- Any non-success scanner conclusion emits `EXECUTED_FAILED`.

#### 3. Empirical Test Proof
- `test_apisec_and_fortify_scan_outcome_checked_before_reporting_passed` in `20_TESTS/regression/test_workflow_security_audit.py`: Validates step IDs and conditional branching.
- `test_blocker5_ci_reporting_distinguishes_passed_from_failed_and_rejects_masking` in `security/tests/test_audit_remediation.py`: Simulates scanner failure and verifies that status evaluates strictly to `EXECUTED_FAILED`.
