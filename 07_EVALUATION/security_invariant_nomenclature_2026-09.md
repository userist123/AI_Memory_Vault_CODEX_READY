**Date**: `2026-09-03`  
**Task**: `STANDARDIZE_SECURITY_INVARIANT_NOMENCLATURE`

## 1. Executive Summary & Canonical Hierarchy

This report establishes the authoritative, repository-wide standardization of security invariant terminology to eliminate ambiguity between `P0-P15`, `P0-P18`, `P0-001...P0-015`, `I-001...I-012`, and `P16-P18`.

### The Standardized Canonical Hierarchy

| Designation | Formal Meaning | Type | Authoritative Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`P0`** | **Phase 4.3 Priority-0 Security Hardening** | Milestone & Priority Designation | `99_SYSTEM/Phase43_P0_Implementation_Contract.md` |
| **`P0-001` .. `P0-015`** | **15 Adversarial Test Contracts** | Test Contract Identifiers | `99_SYSTEM/Phase43_P0_Implementation_Contract.md:Part 11` |
| **`I-001` .. `I-012`** | **Canonical Phase 4.3 Memory Security Invariants** | Memory Trust & Security Invariants | `99_SYSTEM/Phase43_P0_Implementation_Contract.md:Part 14` |
| **`I-RETRIEVAL`** | **Unified Secure Memory Retrieval Invariant** | Retrieval Security Rule | `cognitive_core/recall_cli.py` & `AGENTS.md` |
| **`P1` / `P2` / `P3`** | **Forensic Priority Tiers** | Defect & Architecture Severity Tiers | `99_SYSTEM/Phase43_Forensic_Validation.md` |
| **`P16` / `P17` / `P18`** | **Physical Desktop & Hardware Forensics Invariants** | Hardware & OS Forensics Invariants | `.agents/rules/vault_cognitive_rules.md:Section 4` |
| **`P0-P18`** | **Umbrella Shorthand** | Synthetic Macro Shorthand | Composite shorthand; **NOT** 19 sequential memory invariants |

## 2. Definitive Clarifications

### A. P0 is a Priority Designation, Not an Individual Invariant
- In the Phase 4.3 remediation milestone, findings were categorized by forensic priority:
  - `P0`: Security / Trust-boundary violation
  - `P1`: Correctness / Data integrity
  - `P2`: Architectural weakness
  - `P3`: Maintainability
- `P0` refers to the overall priority of the security hardening effort targeting findings OMEGA-001 (AI self-verification), OMEGA-002 (provenance forgery), and OMEGA-006 (lifecycle escalation). It is not the name of an individual invariant.

### B. P0-001 through P0-015 are Adversarial Test Contracts
- Defined in `99_SYSTEM/Phase43_P0_Implementation_Contract.md` (Part 11).
- These 15 test contracts verify that the memory controller rejects unauthorized actions:
  - `P0-001`: AI cannot propose verified notes
  - `P0-002`: AI cannot claim official provenance
  - `P0-003`: AI cannot claim user provenance
  - `P0-004`: AI cannot inject ACTIVE lifecycle at creation
  - `P0-005`: AI cannot escalate verification to verified via update()
  - `P0-006`: Provenance `source_type` is immutable post-creation
  - `P0-007`: Lifecycle update immutability regression check
  - `P0-008`: Direct controller attack protection without ToolRouter
  - `P0-009`: ToolRouter propagates security rejection
  - `P0-010`: HUMAN can attest notes
  - `P0-011`: ADMIN can attest notes
  - `P0-012`: LearningEngine promotion restricted to partially_verified
  - `P0-013`: Zero partial write on rejected proposal
  - `P0-014`: Restart preserves attested trust state
  - `P0-015`: Supersession isolates trust attributes
- They are test-contract identifiers, **not** the names of 16 sequential invariants.

### C. I-001 through I-012 are the Canonical Memory Security Invariants
- Defined in `99_SYSTEM/Phase43_P0_Implementation_Contract.md` (Part 14).
- When referring to actual memory security rules, documentation must cite these IDs:
  - `I-001`: AI cannot self-verify
  - `I-002`: AI cannot claim privileged provenance (`user`, `official`, `experience`, `import`)
  - `I-003`: AI cannot inject escalated lifecycle at creation (only `RAW`, `CLASSIFIED`, `NORMALIZED`, `REVIEW` permitted)
  - `I-004`: Verification escalation requires authorized attestation (`Operation.ATTEST` by `HUMAN` or `ADMIN`)
  - `I-005`: Provenance `source_type` is principal-scoped at creation and immutable thereafter
  - `I-006`: Security fields cannot be arbitrarily overwritten by caller payload
  - `I-007`: Rejected payloads never persist (zero partial writes)
  - `I-008`: `MemoryController` is the authoritative security boundary, independent of callers
  - `I-009`: Legitimate AI provenance (`inference`, `ai`, `execution`, `unknown`) continues working
  - `I-010`: `LearningEngine` cannot manufacture `verified`, only `partially_verified`
  - `I-011`: Supersession does not transfer verification or provenance trust attributes
  - `I-012`: Restart/reload preserves attested trust state

### D. I-RETRIEVAL is the Unified Secure Retrieval Invariant
- Formally introduced following the security audit of `recall_cli.py`.
- Enforces that all memory queries across both REST API and CLI fallback must delegate to `MemoryController.search()` under `Principal.AI_AGENT`.
- Unauthenticated filesystem scans, raw `os.walk` traversals, or direct memory folder scraping are strictly prohibited.
- Identified explicitly as `I-RETRIEVAL` to avoid false renumbering of the canonical `I-001..I-012` suite.

### E. P16 through P18 are Desktop & Hardware Forensics Invariants
- Introduced in the desktop forensics subsystem (`projects/registru-transferuri`) and codified in `.agents/rules/vault_cognitive_rules.md` (Section 4):
  - `P16`: Hardware Telemetry Immutability (VID, PID, Serial, capacity, System Host ID, timestamp, hash read-only)
  - `P17`: Friendly Name Isolation (user can alter logical labels without altering physical IDs)
  - `P18`: Forensics & Chain of Custody Integrity (transfers bind immutable hardware fingerprint to tamper-evident audit log)
- These apply strictly to operating system hardware forensics and are completely separate from the memory controller invariants.

### F. P0-P18 is an Umbrella Shorthand Only
- Authors concatenated `P0-P15` (the 15 Phase 4.3 test contracts) with `P16-P18` (the 3 hardware forensics invariants).
- `P0-P18` must **never** be described as 19 sequential memory invariants.
