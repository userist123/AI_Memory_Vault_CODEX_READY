# r008 Canonical File Naming Evaluation Report

- **Task**: `r008/canonical-file-naming`
- **Owner**: ANTIGRAVITY
- **Date**: 2026-09-06
- **Base Commit**: `e804c6de0` (from `r007/reviewed-edge-promotion`)
- **Final Commits**:
  - `abf71c744`: `chore(naming): rename 00_GOVERNANCE readmes to canonical taxonomy`
  - `b58f43c82`: `chore(naming): rename 10_DOCUMENTATION readmes to canonical taxonomy`
  - `ca9b7e72d`: `chore(naming): rename 02_PRODUCT readmes to canonical taxonomy`
  - `76ded67dc`: `chore(naming): rename 01_ARCHITECTURE readmes to canonical taxonomy`
- **Status**: SUCCESS / COMPLETE

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Task r008 executed the canonical file naming standard (`00_GOVERNANCE/standards/NEURAL_NAMING_TAXONOMY.md`) across the four core vault roots (`00_GOVERNANCE`, `01_ARCHITECTURE`, `02_PRODUCT`, and `10_DOCUMENTATION`), eliminating the collapse of generic `readme` files into ambiguous graph collisions.

### Key Metrics
- **Files Renamed via `git mv`**: Exactly 81 files (preserving full Git commit history).
- **Navigation Stubs Generated**: 71 `README.md` stubs with `type: index` and `category: navigation` to preserve clean GitHub directory rendering while ensuring `VaultIndex` ignores them during runtime graph traversal (`drop_navigation=True`).
- **Filename Collisions**: 0 collisions among the 81 canonical filenames globally across all tracked repository files.
- **YAML Frontmatter Integrity**: 100% of modified and newly created files validated via `yaml.safe_load()`. Note `id:` properties were strictly preserved where already established.
- **Stale Links Remaining**: 0 stale links targeting obsolete filenames.
- **Runtime Graph Edges**: Increased from **301** to **314** edges (+13 real semantic edges).
- **Nodes with Outgoing Edges**: Increased from **120** to **135** nodes (+15 active nodes).
- **Total Indexed Notes**: Increased from **936** to **938** notes.
- **Hub Concentration (Top 8 Targets)**: Maintained healthy distribution at **28.66%** (90 / 314 edges).
- **Pytest Suite**: **1180 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed** in 19.40s (100% passing against baseline).
- **Repository Layout**: `LAYOUT_STATUS=PASS` (19,177 tracked files).

## 6. Remaining Gaps & Next Steps

1. **`SKILL.md` (3877 files)** and `.agents/` (117 files) were intentionally kept untouched per `NEURAL_NAMING_TAXONOMY.md` rules because `skill_ingestion.py` relies on `SKILL.md` as its ingestion contract.
2. **Duplicate generic note titles in non-spine content**: 22 legacy notes outside the four spine specifications share generic titles (e.g. `current.md` in agent coordination folders, `identity.md` in legacy drafts). These do not affect runtime graph resolution because agent coordination files are explicitly excluded from cognitive recall.
3. **Continuous Indexing**: Future proposals from `edge_proposer.py` will now cleanly resolve canonical stems without collapsing into `readme` slug collisions.
