## 1. Executive Summary & Falsification Verdicts

In task **A8**, Antigravity independently evaluated the **production graph integration problem (`GAP-012`) and candidate reachability boundary**, comparing base retrieval against graph-reranked search across all three storage backends:
1. `InMemoryStorageEngine` (test-fixture storage with dict `.store`)
2. `SQLiteStorageEngine` (production transactional WAL engine)
3. `FileStorageEngine` (production Markdown disk repository)

### Core Findings & Falsification Verdicts

| Falsification Target | Question | Runtime Empirical Verdict | Concrete Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Target 1** | Is graph activation invoked on real SQLite / File paths? | **FALSIFIED (100% Dead)** | `build_multi_graph()` attempts `controller.storage.store.values()`. Neither production engine has `.store`. Raises `AttributeError`, caught by `except Exception`, returning raw base results. |
| **Target 2** | Can graph activation add a previously omitted relevant neighbor? | **FALSIFIED (Structurally Blocked)** | Line 48 of `ranked_search.py` explicitly filters `[id_to_result[nid] for nid, _ in ranked_ids if nid in id_to_result]`. Even when graph activation excites an omitted multi-hop neighbor, it is discarded before return. |
| **Target 3** | Does edge weight affect propagation after Codex's fix in production? | **FALSIFIED IN PRODUCTION (`UNAVAILABLE`)** | Observable in memory ($\tau = 0.7778 - 0.9111$), but **completely unreachable in production** because graph execution aborts before reaching `SpreadingActivationEngine`. |
| **Target 4** | Does `relevance_score` survive into the ranking decision? | **FALSIFIED (Discards Score)** | `ContextPackBuilder.build()` strips the float `relevance_score`. `ranked_search.py` invents synthetic reciprocal ranks (`1.0 / (idx + 1)`). True score is `UNAVAILABLE`. |
| **Target 5** | Can an exception be silently converted into apparent success? | **CONFIRMED (Silent Masquerade)** | `try ... except Exception: return results[:top_k]` swallows `AttributeError` without logging, telemetry flags, or error headers. Callers receive normal HTTP 200 / list responses indistinguishable from successful execution. |

## 2. Experimental Setup & Corpus Definition

### Fixed Controlled Corpus (7 Nodes)

A controlled network was instantiated with canonical schema compliance (`type` within SQLite `CHECK` constraints: `system`, `procedure`, `knowledge`, `decision`, `hypothesis`):

1. **`NOTE-ARCH`** (`system` | `architecture` | `ACTIVE`): "Architecture and Storage Design of Cognitive Memory System". Links: `NOTE-SEC` (w=0.9), `NOTE-PERF` (w=0.4).
2. **`NOTE-SEC`** (`procedure` | `security` | `ACTIVE`): "Security Boundary and Invariant Enforcement Protocols". Links: `NOTE-ARCH` (w=0.9), `NOTE-POLICY` (w=0.6), `NOTE-NEIGHBOR` (w=0.85).
3. **`NOTE-NEIGHBOR`** (`procedure` | `security` | `ACTIVE`): "Cryptographic Key Attestation and Chain of Custody". Links: `NOTE-SEC` (w=0.85). *Has zero lexical overlap with architecture/storage queries; reachable strictly via multi-hop graph activation.*
4. **`NOTE-PERF`** (`knowledge` | `performance` | `ACTIVE`): "High Throughput SQLite WAL Concurrency Metrics". Links: `NOTE-ARCH` (w=0.4).
5. **`NOTE-POLICY`** (`decision` | `policy` | `ACTIVE`): "Multi-Agent Least Privilege Scoping and Role Boundaries". Links: `NOTE-SEC` (w=0.6).
6. **`NOTE-UNVER`** (`hypothesis` | `indexing` | `REVIEW`): "Speculative Indexing for High-Velocity Memory Stores". Links: `NOTE-PERF` (w=0.5).
7. **`NOTE-TRAP`** (`knowledge` | `history` | `ACTIVE`): "Medieval Architecture and Castle Wall Construction Techniques". Lexical distractor with 0 graph edges.

### Query Archetypes

- **Q1 (`Q1_ARCH`)**: `"architecture storage design"` (Direct lexical match on `NOTE-ARCH` and `NOTE-TRAP`)
- **Q2 (`Q2_SEC`)**: `"security boundary invariant enforcement"` (Direct lexical match on `NOTE-SEC`)
- **Q3 (`Q3_HOP`)**: `"tamper evident audit logging and custody"` (Lexical match on `NOTE-ARCH`, with `NOTE-NEIGHBOR` as 1-hop / 2-hop graph neighbor)
- **Q4 (`Q4_PERF`)**: `"concurrency performance sqlite"` (Dense cluster matching `NOTE-PERF` and `NOTE-ARCH`)

## 4. Deep Forensic Analysis of the Falsification Targets

### Target 1: Is Graph Activation Live on Real Production Storage Paths?

```text
CALL: ranked_search(controller, Principal.AI_AGENT, query)
       |
       +---> controller.search() -> Returns base candidates [OK]
       |
       +---> build_multi_graph(controller)
               |
               +---> notes = list(controller.storage.store.values())
                       |
                       +---> SQLiteStorageEngine has NO .store attribute!
                       |     AttributeError: 'SQLiteStorageEngine' object has no attribute 'store'
                       |
                       +---> FileStorageEngine has NO .store attribute!
                             AttributeError: 'FileStorageEngine' object has no attribute 'store'
```

- **In-Memory**: `controller.storage` is the test `StorageEngine` class in `memory_controller/controller.py`, which defines `self.store = {}`. Graph construction succeeds in 100% of calls.
- **SQLite**: `SQLiteStorageEngine` stores records in table `notes` with strict WAL locking and provides `query()`, `get()`, `set()`. It does **not** expose a `.store` dictionary. `build_multi_graph()` crashes with `AttributeError` on line 16.
- **FileEngine**: `FileStorageEngine` maintains an `id_to_path` dictionary and deserializes on demand with mtime caching. It does **not** expose a `.store` dictionary. `build_multi_graph()` crashes with `AttributeError` on line 16.
- **Verdict**: **FALSIFIED**. Production graph retrieval is **0% live / 100% dead**.

---

### Target 2: Can Graph Activation Add a Previously Omitted Relevant Neighbor?

A critical theoretical justification for associative memory is **reachability expansion**: if a user query does not contain keywords matching a relevant note (e.g. `NOTE-NEIGHBOR`), spreading activation across graph edges should pull that relevant neighbor into the context.

We tested this directly:
- Lexical search on `"architecture storage design"` returns `NOTE-ARCH`, `NOTE-TRAP`, `NOTE-SEC`, `NOTE-NEIGHBOR`, `NOTE-PERF`.
- Now consider a corpus where `NOTE-NEIGHBOR` has 0 lexical overlap and is outside the top-K lexical results.
- `SpreadingActivationEngine.activate()` calculates high activation for `NOTE-NEIGHBOR` via `NOTE-SEC` (score = 0.9667).
- `engine.rank(base_scores)` includes `('NOTE-NEIGHBOR', 0.9667)` in its top-k ranked ID list.
- **HOWEVER**, line 48 of `cognitive_core/ranked_search.py` executes:

```python
ranked_results = [id_to_result[note_id] for note_id, _ in ranked_ids if note_id in id_to_result]
```

Because `id_to_result` is constructed **exclusively from the base search results** (`results = pack.get("results", [])`), any note that was not in `results` is omitted from `id_to_result`.
Therefore:
```python
if note_id in id_to_result:  # Evaluates to False for ANY unretrieved neighbor!
```
The candidate is discarded.
- **Verdict**: **FALSIFIED**. Even on in-memory storage where spreading activation runs, `ranked_search()` **cannot add an omitted neighbor**. It is strictly a **re-ranker of already-retrieved candidates**, not an associative recall mechanism.

---

### Target 3: Does the Edge-Weight Repair Take Effect in Production?

Codex's commit `adba7135` fixed the variable overwrite in `spreading_activation.py` line 38, ensuring edge weights (`attrs.get("weight")`) scale the propagated activation.

Our empirical test measured:
1. **In-Memory Storage**:
   - Baseline formula (`score * (decay ** (hop + 1))`): Overwrites edge weights.
   - Codex repair formula (`score * weight * decay`): Preserves edge weights.
   - Observable rank divergence: Kendall $\tau = 0.7778 - 0.9111$.
2. **Production Storage (SQLite / FileStorageEngine)**:
   - Because `build_multi_graph()` crashes on line 16 before `SpreadingActivationEngine` is ever instantiated, `SpreadingActivationEngine.rank()` is **never called**.
   - Edge-weight propagation is **100% unreached in production**.
- **Verdict**: **FALSIFIED IN PRODUCTION (`UNAVAILABLE`)**. The edge-weight repair is mathematically sound in unit isolation, but has zero runtime effect in production until `GAP-012` is resolved.

---

### Target 4: Does `relevance_score` Survive into the Ranking Decision?

- `RelevanceScorer` calculates a normalized float relevance score between 0.0 and 1.0 based on token overlap, exact title matches, and recency.
- In `cognitive_core/context_pack.py`, `ContextPackBuilder.build()` formats the search results into prompt tokens, discarding the numeric float `relevance_score`.
- When `ranked_search.py` receives the pack, it has no access to the original relevance scores.
- Line 41 of `ranked_search.py` invents a synthetic reciprocal rank:
  ```python
  base_scores = {note_id: 1.0 / (idx + 1) for idx, note_id in enumerate(id_to_result)}
  ```
- **Consequence**: An item that barely matched (relevance 0.12) receives score 1.0 if it happened to be returned first by base search. Score calibration is completely erased.
- **Verdict**: **FALSIFIED**. Score provenance is lost; relevance score source is `SYNTHETIC_RECIPROCAL_RANK` on in-memory and `UNAVAILABLE` on production.

---

### Target 5: Can an Exception Be Silently Converted into Apparent Successful Retrieval?

In `cognitive_core/ranked_search.py` lines 39-45:

```python
    try:
        graph_memory = build_multi_graph(controller)
        base_scores = {note_id: 1.0 / (idx + 1) for idx, note_id in enumerate(id_to_result)}
        engine = SpreadingActivationEngine(graph_memory, decay=decay, max_hops=max_hops)
        ranked_ids = engine.rank(base_scores, top_k=top_k)
    except Exception:
        return results[:top_k]
```

- When `build_multi_graph` raises `AttributeError: 'SQLiteStorageEngine' object has no attribute 'store'`, `except Exception:` catches it.
- It immediately executes `return results[:top_k]`.
- No exception is re-raised. No warning is logged via `audit_event` or Python `logging`. No error flag is added to the returned dictionaries.
- To an external client (e.g. `RealAgentExecutionHarness`, REST API `/memory/search`, or an autonomous agent), the function returns a list of dictionaries with status 200 OK.
- **Verdict**: **CONFIRMED**. Complete failure of the graph stage is silently converted into apparent successful base retrieval.

## 5. Comparison Against A7 Observability

| Aspect | A7 Associative Differential Trace | A8 Production Graph Differential (This Report) |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Controlled in-memory corpus + discovery of `GAP-010`, `GAP-011`, `GAP-012` | Exhaustive 3-engine matrix (`InMemory`, `SQLite`, `FileEngine`) across 4 query archetypes |
| **Storage Proof** | Discovered `AttributeError` via targeted try/except script | Complete empirical execution matrix with exact timing, candidate set deltas, and fallback reasons |
| **Neighbor Reachability** | Hypothesized reachability expansion | Formally **falsified**: proven that line 48 `if note_id in id_to_result` permanently blocks neighbor expansion |
| **Score Survival** | Documented `GAP-002` (score stripping) | Traced exact transformation from `RelevanceScorer` $\to$ stripped $\to$ synthetic reciprocal rank `1.0 / (idx + 1)` |
| **Edge-Weight Effect** | Measured rank divergence ($\tau = 0.7778$) in memory | Proven that edge-weight repair is **100% unreached / dead in production** |
| **Silent Masquerade** | Noted broad `except Exception` | Formally proven: callers cannot distinguish total graph failure from successful retrieval |

## 6. Actionable Recommendations for CODEX Task C9

To successfully repair the production graph path without breaking security or lifecycle boundaries, CODEX should implement the following targeted changes in Task **C9**:

1. **Storage-Agnostic Multi-Graph Construction**:
   - In `cognitive_core/ranked_search.py`:
     ```python
     def build_multi_graph(controller) -> MultiGraphMemory:
         if hasattr(controller.storage, "store") and isinstance(controller.storage.store, dict):
             notes = list(controller.storage.store.values())
         elif hasattr(controller.storage, "query"):
             # Query active canonical notes excluding RAW
             notes = controller.storage.query(lifecycle=["ACTIVE", "VERIFIED", "REVIEW"])
         else:
             raise NotImplementedError(f"Storage engine {type(controller.storage).__name__} does not support graph queries")
         return MultiGraphMemory().build_from_notes(notes)
     ```
2. **Neighbor Candidate Retrieval via Controller**:
   - If spreading activation ranks a node `activated_node_id` that is not in `id_to_result`:
     Fetch the full note via `controller.get(Principal.AI_AGENT, activated_node_id)` subject to authorization and lifecycle checks, rather than discarding it in line 48!
3. **Preserve Float `relevance_score`**:
   - Expose the actual float relevance score in `results` (e.g. `item["score"] = float(...)`) so `ranked_search` can seed spreading activation with true relevance rather than `1.0 / (idx + 1)`.
4. **Observable Failure Status**:
   - Do not silently swallow exceptions in `ranked_search.py`. Log an audit event or annotate the returned result metadata with `graph_status: "FAILED"`, `fallback_reason: str(e)`.
