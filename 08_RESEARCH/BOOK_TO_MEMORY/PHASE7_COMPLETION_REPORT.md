# Phase 7 Completion Report — Book-to-Memory End-to-End Pipeline & Pilot

> **Evidence caveat (2026-10-07, PR #209 B01/B09).** "Fully verified" below means the unit tests
> pass. Any usage-test or ablation figure produced by the pipeline's former built-in defaults (fixed
> rubric, no model answers, no rater) is **not empirical evidence**; see the retraction in
> `PHASE7_PILOT_EXECUTION_REPORT.md`. Those defaults are removed: missing data now yields
> `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, never a pass.


**Document Version**: 1.0.0  
**Phase**: Phase 7 — End-to-End Pipeline & Book Pilot Ingestion  
**Branch**: `research/book-to-memory-phase7-pipeline`  
**Parent HEAD**: `7bfc5ff61`  
**Status**: COMPLETED & FULLY VERIFIED  
**Date**: 2026-10-04

## 1. Executive Summary

Phase 7 successfully completes the construction, integration, and pilot verification of the **Book-to-Memory End-to-End Pipeline** in strict compliance with `00_GOVERNANCE/rules/POLICY-LEARNING-QUALITY-02.md`.

All individual building blocks developed and verified across Phases 1 through 6:
1. Phase 1: Ontology & 11 Atomic Schemas
2. Phase 2: Lifecycle Gates (`GATE-01..GATE-08`)
3. Phase 3: Conflict Registry (`CONFLICT-<domain>-<slug>`)
4. Phase 4: Task-Based Usage Testing ($\ge 8/10$)
5. Phase 5: Paired Ablation Testing ($\text{Delta} \ge 0$)
6. Phase 6: Retrieval & Working Memory Context Packaging

have now been united into a single, cohesive, production-ready pipeline class: `BookToMemoryPipeline` in [book_to_memory_pipeline.py](file:///C:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY/03_IMPLEMENTATION/packages/lifecycle/validation/book_to_memory_pipeline.py).

## 4. Governance & Policy Adherence Checklist

- [x] **No Auto-Promotion**: Candidate notes stay strictly in `VERIFIED` state without Owner approval token.
- [x] **Zero Untrusted Code Execution**: Directives in notes are intercepted and blocked as passive data.
- [x] **Conflict Invariant**: Active conflicts block `ACTIVE` status.
- [x] **Task Rigor**: Rote copying is rejected; usage test requires $\ge 8/10$.
- [x] **Ablation Rigor**: Paired evaluation across $\ge 2$ models and $\ge 3$ repetitions; negative deltas blocked.
- [x] **Retrieval Isolation**: Delimited passive context blocks ensure LLMs cannot mistake book content for instructions.
- [x] **Branch Isolation**: All work committed cleanly on `research/book-to-memory-phase7-pipeline`. Main branch untouched. Zero merges.
