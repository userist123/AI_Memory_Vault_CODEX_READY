# Phase 8 Completion Report — Book-to-Memory Corpus Catalog & Reversible Consolidation

**Document Version**: 1.0.0  
**Phase**: Phase 8 — Corpus Catalog & Reversible Consolidation  
**Branch**: `research/book-to-memory-phase8-consolidation`  
**Parent HEAD**: `41463ab18` (Phase 7)  
**Status**: COMPLETED; UNIT TESTS PASS (211/211); NOT EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED  
**Date**: 2026-10-04

## 1. Executive Summary

Phase 8 implements the **Book-to-Memory Corpus Catalog and Reversible Consolidation** system (`BookToMemoryCatalog`), resolving the architectural gap between legacy informal book maps and the rigorous, schema-compliant `type: book_map` standard mandated by `00_GOVERNANCE/rules/POLICY-LEARNING-QUALITY-02.md`.

With Phase 8:
1. The centralized `BookToMemoryCatalog` is fully operational in [book_to_memory_catalog.py](file:///C:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY/03_IMPLEMENTATION/packages/lifecycle/validation/book_to_memory_catalog.py).
2. All 7 core monographs from `06_INBOX/Carti/` have been registered and validated.
3. Chapter coverage and gap analysis are quantitatively measured and auditable.
4. Bidirectional linkage connects atomic concept notes in the `VERIFIED` state to their parent book maps.
5. All notes remain strictly in `VERIFIED` state (no auto-promotion to `ACTIVE` without explicit owner attestation).

## 4. Invariant Compliance Checklist

- [x] **No Auto-Promotion**: All catalog records and linked notes are kept in `VERIFIED` state (`AWAITING_OWNER_APPROVAL`).
- [x] **Zero Raw Text Infiltration**: Raw monograph texts remain in `06_INBOX/Carti/` and never enter active retrieval.
- [x] **Zero Untrusted Execution**: Directive keys (`tool_call`, `exec`, `shell_command`) are intercepted with `SecurityInjectionError`.
- [x] **One Book, One Map**: Enforced uniquely by `source_identity`.
- [x] **Transparent Coverage**: Chapter coverage and knowledge gaps are quantitatively measured.
- [x] **Branch Isolation**: All changes isolated on `research/book-to-memory-phase8-consolidation`. Main branch untouched. Zero merges.
