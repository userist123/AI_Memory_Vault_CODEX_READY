**Phase**: Phase 9 — Problem Matrix Traceability & Systematic Hypothesis Validation Engine  
**Branch**: `research/book-to-memory-phase9-hypothesis`  
**Parent HEAD**: `b0cf20727` (Phase 8)

## 1. Overview & Objective

This report establishes end-to-end traceability between the **17 Canonical Vault Engineering Problems** defined in [PROBLEM_MATRIX.md](file:///C:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY/08_RESEARCH/PROBLEM_MATRIX.md) and the operational hypotheses managed by the `BookToMemoryHypothesisRegistry`.

In accordance with `POLICY-LEARNING-QUALITY-02` Section 14, every hypothesis track bridges:
$$\text{Biological Observation} \longrightarrow \text{Engineering Hypothesis} \longrightarrow \text{Controlled Experiment} \longrightarrow \text{Vault Mechanism}$$

## 3. Detailed Traceability of Active H1 Hypotheses

### 3.1 H1-BOOK-001: Proactive Interference Boundary Gating
- **Problem**: `interference_conflict` (Proactive memory interference degrading retrieval accuracy).
- **Biological Source**: Alan Baddeley, *The Psychology of Memory*, Chapter 4 (Proactive and retroactive interference dynamics).
- **Engineering Hypothesis**: Introducing an automated similarity and domain-temporal discriminant boundary between conflicting candidate notes will reduce false associative retrieval of outdated procedural advice by at least 15%.
- **Operational Metric**: Retrieval precision under conflicting distractor queries.
- **Target Delta**: $\ge +15\%$ precision with zero regression in recall.
- **Status**: Registered, `HYPOTHESIS_READY`.

### 3.2 H1-BOOK-002: Synaptic Weight Dual Routing
- **Problem**: `retrieval_indirect_cues` (Failure to retrieve relevant procedures when queries share zero direct keywords).
- **Biological Source**: Eric Kandel, *Principles of Neural Science*, 5th Ed., Chapter 65 (Synaptic plasticity and heterosynaptic facilitation).
- **Engineering Hypothesis**: A dual-index routing mechanism combining dense semantic proximity with graph co-activation topology will successfully retrieve target procedures on indirect queries where lexical search scores 0/10.
- **Operational Metric**: Mean reciprocal rank (MRR) on indirect cue queries.
- **Target Delta**: $\ge +20\%$ recall.
- **Status**: Registered, `HYPOTHESIS_READY`.

### 3.3 H1-BOOK-003: Reversible Two-Phase Consolidation
- **Problem**: `consolidation` (Unchecked growth of working memory notes causing context explosion).
- **Biological Source**: Eric Kandel, *Principles of Neural Science*, Chapter 67 (Early-phase vs late-phase memory consolidation).
- **Engineering Hypothesis**: Moving intermediate notes through a progressive two-stage consolidation lifecycle (ephemeral working cache to schema-enforced immutable semantic cards) reduces working memory token bloat by at least 25% while preserving full lineage traceability.
- **Operational Metric**: Context token cost per multi-turn session.
- **Target Delta**: $\ge 25\%$ token reduction.
- **Status**: Registered, `HYPOTHESIS_READY`.

### 3.4 H1-BOOK-004: Dynamic Working Memory Chunking
- **Problem**: `working_memory` (Context window token saturation during complex council deliberations).
- **Biological Source**: Alan Baddeley, *Working Memory, Thought, and Action*, Chapter 2 (The multi-component model and phonological loop constraints).
- **Engineering Hypothesis**: Dynamic hierarchical chunking of retrieved context packs constrained to $\le 3$ conceptual units per council turn will prevent council hallucination while reducing prompt token consumption by $\ge 30\%$.
- **Operational Metric**: Working memory token consumption per query.
- **Target Delta**: $\ge 30\%$ compaction.
- **Status**: Registered, `HYPOTHESIS_READY`.

### 3.5 H1-BOOK-005: Salience-Weighted Epistemic Gating
- **Problem**: `salience_attention` (Agent attention diluted across low-relevance background context).
- **Biological Source**: Daniel Kahneman, *Attention and Effort*, Chapter 3 (Selective allocation of attention and capacity limitations).
- **Engineering Hypothesis**: Weighting candidate context injections by epistemic confidence and novelty salience filters out background noise, raising task completion speed and accuracy.
- **Operational Metric**: Usage test score on noisy distraction tasks.
- **Target Delta**: $\ge +18\%$ relevance density.
- **Status**: Registered, `HYPOTHESIS_READY`.

## 5. Summary & Next Steps for Subsequent Phases

1. All 5 initial hypotheses have been securely parsed, validated against malicious directives, and registered with immutable references.
2. The remaining 12 canonical problems remain cataloged and awaiting hypothesis formulation in subsequent research cycles.
3. Every active hypothesis is bound to the anti-gaming evaluation contract requiring $\ge 5$ paired samples before owner decision package submission.
