# Phase 9 Completion Report — Problem Matrix Traceability & Systematic Hypothesis Validation Engine

**Document Version**: 1.0.0  
**Phase**: Phase 9 — Problem Matrix Traceability & Systematic Hypothesis Validation Engine  
**Branch**: `research/book-to-memory-phase9-hypothesis`  
**Parent HEAD**: `b0cf20727` (Phase 8)  
**Status**: COMPLETED; UNIT TESTS PASS (225/225); NOT EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED  
**Date**: 2026-10-04

## 1. Executive Summary

Phase 9 implements the **Systematic Hypothesis Validation Engine & Problem Matrix Traceability** architecture (`BookToMemoryHypothesisRegistry`), fully operationalizing Section 14 of `00_GOVERNANCE/rules/POLICY-LEARNING-QUALITY-02.md`:
$$\text{BIOLOGICAL FACT} \longrightarrow \text{ENGINEERING HYPOTHESIS} \longrightarrow \text{CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT} \longrightarrow \text{VAULT MECHANISM}$$

With Phase 9:
1. The **`BookToMemoryHypothesisRegistry`** is fully implemented and tested in [book_to_memory_hypothesis.py](file:///C:/Users/Marius/Documents/Codex/AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY/03_IMPLEMENTATION/packages/lifecycle/validation/book_to_memory_hypothesis.py).
2. The **8-state finite state machine** (`TrackState`) strictly governs hypothesis maturation from source extraction to validated change.
3. The **Zero-Jump Invariant** is enforced at the code boundary; skipping intermediate validation states is rejected with explicit errors.
4. **Anti-gaming safeguards** mandate $\ge 5$ samples, paired evaluations (`WITH_NOTE` vs `WITHOUT_NOTE`), non-negative failure tracking, and explicit reporting of both absolute and relative deltas.
5. `Principal.AI_AGENT` is cryptographically barred from transitioning any hypothesis to `CLOSED_CHANGE_VALIDATED`; human owner attestation (`Principal.HUMAN`) is mandatory.
6. All 17 canonical problems in `08_RESEARCH/PROBLEM_MATRIX.md` are indexed with status tracking, and 5 foundational hypotheses (`H1-BOOK-001..005`) are registered.

## 4. Governance & Policy Verification

- **Authority**: Strictly adheres to `00_GOVERNANCE/rules/POLICY-LEARNING-QUALITY-02.md` Section 14 and `RESEARCH-TRACK-CONTRACT.md`.
- **Zero Production Mutation**: No production code or core council orchestrator files modified.
- **Zero Auto-Promotion**: No hypothesis promoted to `CLOSED_CHANGE_VALIDATED` without human owner signature.
- **Untrusted Input Invariant**: Books treated as untrusted inspiration; zero raw text admitted into active memory.
- **Branch Isolation**: All changes executed strictly on `research/book-to-memory-phase9-hypothesis`.
