working_branch_policy: MAIN_ONLY
agent_execution_policy: SEQUENTIAL_HANDOFF
current_round: R001
active_work:
  - cognitive-memory target model and Planning Influence MVE on main
  - deterministic MVE calibration and experiment readiness
  - single-main sequential execution
recent_state:
  - Perplexity adversarial validation: ACCEPT WITH CHANGES / GO WITH MANDATORY MVE CHANGES
  - main is the only canonical working branch for ongoing development
  - README was restored atomically to the verified Marius-authored canonical version from 19537264; no production or MVE code changed in the restore
  - GAP-011 lifecycle classifier substring matching fixed with whole-word matching
  - deterministic Planning Influence MVE contains four arms and soft priors
  - oracle-leak flaw removed: treatment priors derive from independent frozen memory recommendations
  - MVE test corrected so stale/wrong memory is not assumed to succeed
  - MVE quality diagnostic added to separate correct and incorrect memory recommendations
  - applicability-aware influence added: APPLICABLE=full, APPLICABLE_WITH_VERIFICATION=reduced, INSUFFICIENTLY_KNOWN=further reduced, NOT_APPLICABLE=neutral
  - frozen applicability states are now routed through the treatment arm instead of being tested only in compile_memory isolation
  - local applicability-aware pilot: advisory 30 nodes / 0 fatal; treatment 54 nodes / 12 fatal; stale 30 nodes / 0 fatal
  - applicability distribution: 8 APPLICABLE, 8 APPLICABLE_WITH_VERIFICATION, 7 INSUFFICIENTLY_KNOWN, 7 NOT_APPLICABLE
  - treatment recommendation matched optimal in 7/30 cases; mismatch group used 47 treatment nodes and recorded 12 fatal visits
  - treatment_vs_advisory_node_reduction = -0.8000; this is improved versus prior 125-node treatment but still negative
  - no post-hoc parameter tuning used to force improvement
  - applicability-aware pilot result persisted in 07_EVALUATION/luna/PLANNING_INFLUENCE_APPLICABILITY_PILOT_LOCAL_20260904.md
  - latest CI MVE job observed as queued; no CI runtime claim made
open_requirements:
  - await GitHub Actions execution for the latest applicability-aware MVE and Memory V6
  - do not promote deterministic pilot to model-level cognitive-planning evidence
  - freeze calibration only after CI verification and a pre-registered uncertainty policy
  - separate applicability, evidence strength, verification cost, planner influence and outcome in the next isolated experiment
  - only then design the model-backed paired MVE
  - no feature-branch development
  - no parallel agent work on the same project task chain
  - preserve resumable handoff state every session
blockers:
  - GitHub Actions may remain queued; no CI runtime artifact is accepted until verified
  - local environment cannot clone GitHub directly
  - remote branch deletion requires explicit delete-ref capability and must not be fabricated
  - Codex unavailable this week
next_actions:
  - verify newest applicability-aware MVE CI run and inspect artifact/stdout
  - verify Memory V6 CI and inspect test results
  - create a pre-registered uncertainty-policy design in the isolated MVE harness
  - rerun the deterministic pilot only against that frozen design
  - proceed to model-backed paired MVE only after deterministic calibration is successful or explicitly falsified
