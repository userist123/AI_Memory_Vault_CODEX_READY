status: ACTIVE
working_branch_policy: MAIN_ONLY
agent_execution_policy: SEQUENTIAL_HANDOFF
current_round: R001
active_work:
  - cognitive-memory target model and Planning Influence MVE on main
  - deterministic MVE calibration and experiment readiness
  - single-main sequential execution
recent_state:
  - Perplexity adversarial validation: ACCEPT WITH CHANGES / GO WITH MANDATORY MVE CHANGES
  - main is the only canonical working branch for ongoing development
  - README was restored atomically to the verified Marius-authored canonical version from 19537264; no production or MVE code changed in the restore
  - GAP-011 lifecycle classifier substring matching fixed with whole-word matching
  - deterministic Planning Influence MVE contains four arms and soft priors
  - oracle-leak flaw removed: treatment priors derive from independent frozen memory recommendations
  - MVE test corrected so stale/wrong memory is not assumed to succeed
  - MVE quality diagnostic added to separate correct and incorrect memory recommendations
  - applicability-aware influence added: APPLICABLE=full, APPLICABLE_WITH_VERIFICATION=reduced, INSUFFICIENTLY_KNOWN=further reduced, NOT_APPLICABLE=neutral
  - local deterministic mechanics checks passed before applicability extension; no new local pass is claimed for the latest extension
  - local pilot result: advisory 30 nodes / 0 fatal; treatment 125 nodes / 15 fatal
  - treatment recommendation matched optimal in 7/30 cases; 23/30 mismatched
  - negative result preserved as evidence; no post-hoc tuning used to force improvement
  - pilot result persisted in 07_EVALUATION/luna/PLANNING_INFLUENCE_PILOT_LOCAL_20260904.md
open_requirements:
  - await GitHub Actions CI execution for Memory V6 and Planning Influence MVE
  - do not promote deterministic pilot to model-level cognitive-planning evidence
  - verify latest applicability-aware MVE tests and runtime output
  - freeze calibration design only after the latest harness is CI-verified
  - only then design the model-backed paired MVE
  - no feature-branch development
  - no parallel agent work on the same project task chain
  - preserve resumable handoff state every session
blockers:
  - GitHub Actions runs observed during this session may still be queued; no CI runtime artifact is accepted until verified
  - local environment cannot clone GitHub directly
  - remote branch deletion requires explicit delete-ref capability and must not be fabricated
  - Codex unavailable this week
next_actions:
  - verify the newest applicability-aware MVE CI run and inspect artifact/stdout
  - verify Memory V6 CI and inspect test results
  - do not add further calibration changes until latest applicability-aware harness is verified
  - proceed to model-backed paired MVE only after deterministic calibration is successful or explicitly falsified
