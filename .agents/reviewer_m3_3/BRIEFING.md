# BRIEFING — 2026-08-28T14:12:00Z

## Mission
Perform an objective quality review and adversarial challenge of the remediated `jarvis/agents/supervisor.py` and test suite, verifying all 3 concurrency fixes, running the full test suite (all 318 tests), ensuring no integrity violations or regressions, and producing a complete review report and handoff.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: teamwork_preview_reviewer
- Roles: reviewer, critic
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\reviewer_m3_3
- Original parent: 8b531079-7cca-4ec6-a0e3-4ce625943430
- Milestone: m3_3
- Instance: 1 of 1

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Actively check for integrity violations (hardcoded test results, facade logic, bypassed work, fabricated outputs)
- Issue clear verdict: APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES
- Write report.md and handoff.md in working directory
- Send verdict message to parent orchestrator

## Review Scope
- **Files reviewed**: `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/agents/supervisor.py`, `tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_retry.py`, `tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_cancellation.py`, `tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_pending_cancel.py`, `tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_adversarial_deep.py`, full suite (318 tests).
- **Interface contracts**: PROJECT.md, AGENTS.md, vault_cognitive_rules.md
- **Review criteria**: Concurrency safety, cancellation handling, retry idempotence, integrity verification, test suite pass rate (100%).

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**: `supervisor.py` concurrency and lifecycle fixes (retry duplicate elimination, CancelledError handling, pending cancel skipping), adversarial stress suite, full 318-test repository run.
- **Verdict**: APPROVE
- **Unverified claims**: None. All claims verified via independent code inspection and live pytest execution.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  1. Retry dispatch could still spawn double workers under concurrency: DISPROVEN (Direct recursion without re-enqueueing guarantees single-worker execution).
  2. CancelledError in `_worker_loop` could kill worker and orphan futures: DISPROVEN (`_dispatch` catches CancelledError, sets CANCELLED status, resolves future, keeps worker alive).
  3. Pending cancelled tasks could execute when dequeued: DISPROVEN (`_cancelled_task_ids` guard immediately detects and skips execution).
  4. Semaphore invariant could breach under load: DISPROVEN (Strictly bounded at peak concurrency <= 4 across 100 tasks).
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None.
- **Untested angles**: None within Milestone 3 scope.

## Key Decisions Made
- Issued APPROVE verdict for Milestone 3 concurrency remediation.
- Published `report.md` and `handoff.md`.
