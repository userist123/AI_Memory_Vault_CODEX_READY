<USER_REQUEST>
You are the Project Orchestrator for the OTP Flight Finder rebuild project.

Original User Request and Project Requirements are in:
`c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md` (check the latest section ## 2026-08-26T16:40:26Z).

Project Working Directory:
`C:\Users\Marius\teamwork_projects\otp_flight_finder` (also referenced as `~/teamwork_projects/otp_flight_finder`).

Your Orchestrator Working Directory:
`c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\orchestrator`

Key Requirements to deliver:
1. Rebuild the OTP Flight Finder web application.
2. R1. Strict OTP usage: All generated deep-links for Ryanair (and other airlines) must include both `origin`/`originIata` and `destination`/`destinationIata` parameters set to the correct IATA codes, guaranteeing Ryanair booking opens with OTP selected. Eliminate any fallback to Băneasa (BBU).
3. R2. UI/UX consistency: Apply UI/UX design specifications using relevant skills (responsive layout, Tailwind palette, accessibility compliance) and integrate into static front-end.
4. R3. Verification suite: Provide automated test suite (pytest) validating:
   - Ryanair deep-link opens with OTP pre-selected.
   - No BBU airport appears in any search results or links.
   - All static assets load without UTF-8 BOM issues.
5. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Every Ryanair deep-link generated contains origin/originIata=OTP and destination/destinationIata parameters.
   - Manual testing of "Rezerva" button on live site confirms OTP is pre-filled.
   - Site passes Lighthouse audits (Performance >= 90, Accessibility >= 90, Best Practices >= 90, SEO >= 90).
   - Test coverage >= 80% line coverage with all tests passing.

Operating Protocol:
- Maintain your `plan.md`, `progress.md`, and `BRIEFING.md` in `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\orchestrator\`.
- Regularly update `progress.md` so the Sentinel can track status and liveness.
- Dispatch specialist subagents (workers, reviewers, challengers, test writers) according to your decomposition.
- When all requirements and acceptance criteria are met, report completion back to Sentinel with evidence and summary.
