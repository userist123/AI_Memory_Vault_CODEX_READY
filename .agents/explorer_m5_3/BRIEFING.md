# BRIEFING — 2026-08-14T23:26:45Z

## Mission
Execute full pytest verification, catalog all test modules and counts, and verify Acceptance Criteria from ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: explorer
- Roles: explorer, synthesis, test-verifier

- Original parent: 4b331fbc-eb8c-41a5-8ea8-e64218064557
- Milestone: Milestone 5 - Full Test Suite Status & E2E Pytest Verification

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Read-only investigation — do NOT modify source code
- Authoritative requirements: ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md
- Project plan: PROJECT.md
- Adhere strictly to AGENTS.md and vault_cognitive_rules.md

## Investigation State
- **Explored paths**: `memory_controller/tests/` (19 modules), `cognitive_core/tests/` (29 modules), `cognitive_core/`, `memory_controller/`
- **Key findings**: Full test suite contains 48 modules and 399 tests. 100% passing (399/399 passed in 40.66s, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped). All 9 acceptance criteria in ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md are completely satisfied.
- **Unexplored areas**: None. Entire test suite and acceptance criteria mapping complete.

## Key Decisions Made
- Executed full pytest run with json output and detailed timing.
- Verified test mapping for P0-P15 security invariants, SHA-256 audit chaining, TRACe/IR benchmarks, 10% freshness bonus, Tree-of-Thought, SelfRefine consolidation, execution-gated confidence promotion, and ContinualLearningGuard.
- Generated comprehensive `report.md` and 5-component `handoff.md`.
