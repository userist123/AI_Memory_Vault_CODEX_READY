# BRIEFING — 2026-08-27T19:41:30Z

## Mission
Adversarial stress testing and edge case challenge for Milestone 1 Iteration 2 of Jarvis Cognitive Brain.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: empirical challenger
- Roles: critic, specialist
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\challenger_m1_iter2_1
- Original parent: 5a625f23-4992-4b00-bb13-1f4b316b216c
- Milestone: Milestone 1 Iteration 2
- Instance: 1 of 1

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify production implementation code
- Run verification tests empirically

## Current Parent
- Conversation ID: 5a625f23-4992-4b00-bb13-1f4b316b216c

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**: `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/sqlite_engine.py`, `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/core/models.py`, `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/tests/unit/test_adversarial_m1.py`
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`, `worker_m1_iter2/handoff.md`
- **Review criteria**: SQLite AST expression depth resilience (BM25 token capping), WorkingMemory corrupted payload validation, adversarial pytest suite pass rate

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**: 
  - Token capping at 32 unique terms in `search_bm25()` prevents SQLite AST parser depth exhaustion on 300+ and 5000+ term queries (CONFIRMED PASS).
  - `WorkingMemory.load_state()` rejects non-list structures with `ValueError` and filters out primitive / corrupted items up to capacity limit without memory poisoning (CONFIRMED PASS).
  - Full adversarial suite `tests/unit/test_adversarial_m1.py` runs with 100% pass rate (15/15 passed).
  - Complete project regression suite passes with 167/167 tests (100% pass rate).
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None in current iteration. All prior edge cases (AST overflow, WM state poisoning) have been cleanly resolved and hardened.
- **Untested angles**: Live microphone audio streaming and real physical Home Assistant socket failures are deferred to M2/M4.

## Loaded Skills
- None required

## Key Decisions Made
- All adversarial attack scenarios passed. Verdict: APPROVE.
