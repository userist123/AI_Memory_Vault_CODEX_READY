### Task Objective:
Resume execution starting from Milestone 3 (Multi-Agent Workers), Milestone 4 (FastMCP & IoT Home Assistant Integration), and Milestone 5 (Ultra-Modern 3D Web HUD Interface).

### Context:
- Milestone 1 (Cognitive OODA loop & Memory persistent storage) and Milestone 2 (Cascaded Audio Pipeline with Silero VAD, Faster-Whisper, Kokoro-82M ONNX, and Barge-in/AEC) are ALREADY COMPLETED with 235/235 tests passing cleanly.
- You must build out Milestone 3, Milestone 4, Milestone 5, and the unified production entry point.

### Key Requirements:
1. **Milestone 3: Multi-Agent Worker Orchestration (R3)**
   - Supervisor and specialized least-privilege agent workers: Router, Retrieval, Verifier, Consolidator, Critic.
   - Run background tasks (gathering data, verifying memory compliance, reflection) asynchronously without blocking the primary voice loop.
   - Production module: `jarvis/core/multi_agent.py` (and related modules).

2. **Milestone 4: FastMCP & IoT Home Assistant Integration (R4)**
   - FastMCP tool server (`JarvisControls`) exposing validated tools to query and manipulate IoT device states over a local REST API (`/api/states`).
   - Local Home Assistant simulator script/module to mock Home Assistant REST endpoints for reliable offline testing.
   - Production modules: `jarvis/tools/fastmcp.py`, `jarvis/iot/homeassistant.py` (and simulator).

3. **Milestone 5: Ultra-Modern GUI Dashboard & Web HUD (R5)**
   - WebSocket/HTTP server serving HUD backend events (`jarvis/hud/server.py`).
   - Responsive Web UI dashboard and 3D visualizer showing:
     * Active vocal states (Idle, Listening, Thinking, Speaking) with dynamic sound reactivity.
     * Visual representation of active "thoughts" (OODA execution stages) and memory graphs/citations.
     * System health meters and configuration settings.
   - Production module: `jarvis/hud/server.py` + static web assets (HTML/CSS/JS/Three.js).

4. **Production Entry Point & Integration**
   - Provide a main entry point script (e.g. `jarvis/main.py` or `run.py`) to launch the entire Cognitive Brain along with its audio pipeline, FastMCP server, HUD UI WebSocket server, and Home Assistant client cleanly.
   - Ensure ALL implementations are actual production modules under the `jarvis/` directory, not only test fixtures.

5. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Provide thorough unit and integration tests under `tests/`.
   - Ensure all existing tests (235+) and all new tests pass with 100% success rate under Python 3.12+.

Maintain regular updates to your `progress.md` and `BRIEFING.md` in your metadata folder. Report back when all milestones are complete, fully implemented in production code, and thoroughly tested.
