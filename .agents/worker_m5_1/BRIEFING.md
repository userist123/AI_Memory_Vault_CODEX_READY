# BRIEFING — 2026-08-15T02:29:00Z

## Mission
Execute Milestone 5: Continual Learning, TRACe/IR Benchmarks & Full Pytest Pass.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: worker
- Roles: implementer, qa, specialist
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\worker_m5_1
- Original parent: 4b331fbc-eb8c-41a5-8ea8-e64218064557
- Milestone: Milestone 5 (Continual Learning, TRACe/IR Benchmarks & Full Pytest Pass)

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- DO NOT CHEAT. All implementations must be genuine.
- DO NOT hardcode test results or create facades.
- AI Agent cannot set verification = "verified".
- Promotion to very_high confidence strictly requires source_type == "execution" and sets verification = "partially_verified".
- ContinualLearningGuard must protect registered anchor memories against catastrophic forgetting, deletion, verification downgrade, and content corruption.
- 100% full pytest pass across the entire repository.

## Task Summary
- **What was built/hardened**:
  1. Hardened `ContinualLearningGuard.verify_no_catastrophic_regression` in `cognitive_core/learning.py` to flag verification downgrades and content corruption/drift.
  2. Verified `LearningEngine.promote_memories` execution evidence gating and skipping of human/admin-verified canonical nodes.
  3. Hardened edge cases in `cognitive_core/evaluation.py` (`k <= 0` negative slicing guard in `recall_at_k` and `ndcg_at_k`).
  4. Wrote comprehensive Milestone 5 test suite in `cognitive_core/tests/test_milestone5_continual_learning_eval.py` (23 tests).
  5. Ran full pytest suite across all 49 modules in repository: 422 tests passing, 0 failures, 0 errors.
- **Success criteria**: 100% test pass rate, 0 failures, zero regressions, full adherence to P0-P15 invariants.
- **Interface contracts**: PROJECT.md § Interface Contracts
- **Code layout**: PROJECT.md § Code Layout

## Change Tracker
- **Files modified**:
  - `cognitive_core/learning.py`: Hardened `verify_no_catastrophic_regression` for verification downgrade and content drift.
  - `cognitive_core/evaluation.py`: Added `k <= 0` guards in `recall_at_k` and `ndcg_at_k`.
  - `cognitive_core/tests/test_milestone5_continual_learning_eval.py`: Created comprehensive 23-test test suite.
- **Build status**: 422 passed in 41.06s (100% pass rate)
- **Pending issues**: none

## Quality Status
- **Build/test result**: PASS (422 passed, 0 failed, 0 errors)
- **Lint status**: clean
- **Tests added/modified**: `cognitive_core/tests/test_milestone5_continual_learning_eval.py` (23 new tests)

## Loaded Skills
- **Source**: `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\skills\vault-operations\SKILL.md`
  - **Core methodology**: Operational runbook for recall, safe AI proposal, human attestation, and formal reflexion.
- **Source**: `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\skills\vault-security-audit\SKILL.md`
  - **Core methodology**: Security audit invariants P0-P15, audit log tamper checking, SQLite concurrency constraints.

## Key Decisions Made
- Hardened `ContinualLearningGuard.verify_no_catastrophic_regression` to check `curr.get("verification") != "verified"` if anchor was verified, and check `curr.get("content") != anchor.get("content")` for content drift.
- Hardened `recall_at_k` and `ndcg_at_k` in `cognitive_core/evaluation.py` to guard `k <= 0`.
- Created exhaustive test suite in `cognitive_core/tests/test_milestone5_continual_learning_eval.py` covering continual learning guard, confidence promotion gating, TRACe metrics, and IR benchmarks.
