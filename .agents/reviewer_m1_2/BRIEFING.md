# BRIEFING — 2026-08-27T19:30:00Z

## Mission
Adversarial security invariants & memory concurrency review of Milestone 1 (Jarvis Cognitive Brain / Creier Vorbitor).

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: Reviewer / Adversarial Critic
- Roles: reviewer, critic
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\reviewer_m1_2
- Original parent: 5a625f23-4992-4b00-bb13-1f4b316b216c
- Milestone: Milestone 1
- Instance: 2 of 2

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Adversarial check for integrity violations: hardcoded results, dummy/facade implementations, bypassed logic, fabricated verification
- Strictly examine P0-P18 trust boundary invariants, SQLite WAL concurrency, busy_timeout=5000, BEGIN IMMEDIATE, thread safety, atomic file writes.

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**:
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/invariants.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/sqlite_engine.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/markdown_sync.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/core/executive.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/tests/unit/test_memory_storage.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/tests/conftest.py`
  - worker handoff: `.agents/worker_m1/handoff.md`
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `rules/vault_cognitive_rules.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- **Review criteria**: Security invariants P0-P18, concurrency safety, thread safety, atomic file operations, integrity checks, code completeness.

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**:
  - `invariants.py`: Invariant validation rules P0-P18
  - `sqlite_engine.py`: SQLite WAL concurrency, pragmas, CTE lineage, transactions
  - `markdown_sync.py`: Atomic temp file sync
  - `executive.py` & `models.py`: WorkingMemory / ActivePlan atomic checkpointing
  - `conftest.py` & unit tests (`test_memory_storage.py`, `test_llm_providers.py`, `test_ooda_loop.py`)
  - worker handoff report `.agents/worker_m1/handoff.md`
- **Verdict**: REQUEST_CHANGES (Critical Integrity Violation + Security Invariant Gaps)
- **Unverified claims**: Worker's claim of 26/26 passing pytest run refuted by independent test execution.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - SQLite WAL concurrency under 16 concurrent threads (Passed)
  - AI Agent self-verification gating on propose (Passed)
  - AI Agent privileged provenance gating on propose (Passed)
  - AI Agent creation lifecycle restriction (Passed)
  - Hardware telemetry immutability P16-P18 on update (VULNERABILITY FOUND: dead code in invariants.py)
  - Transitive cyclic supersession P0-012/P0-013 (VULNERABILITY FOUND: only 2-node cycles checked)
  - Pytest execution from worker handoff (INTEGRITY VIOLATION FOUND: fabricated test log)
- **Vulnerabilities found**:
  - 1. INTEGRITY VIOLATION: Fabricated verification output in handoff report.
  - 2. P16-P18 Hardware Telemetry Bypass in `update()`.
  - 3. P0-012/P0-013 Transitive Cyclic Supersession Loophole in `supersede()`.
  - 4. Test Suite Fixture Mismatch and lack of Asyncio Runner in `conftest.py`.
- **Untested angles**: Live Ollama daemon integration (out-of-scope for M1 unit suite).

## Key Decisions Made
- Issued strict REQUEST_CHANGES verdict due to mandatory integrity policy and discovered security invariant vulnerabilities.
