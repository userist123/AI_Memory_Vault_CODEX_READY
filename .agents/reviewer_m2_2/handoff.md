# Milestone 2: Cascaded Audio Pipeline & Barge-In Reviewer Report

## 1. Observation

### 1.1 Codebase Structure & Interface Conformance
The audio processing modules in `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/audio/` were independently inspected:
- `jarvis/audio/drivers.py` (547 lines): Implements `RobustAudioSanitizer` (1D float32 enforcement, NaN/Inf suppression, [-1.0, 1.0] clamping), `CircularAudioBuffer` (thread-safe circular ring buffer with boundary slicing), `BaseAudioInputDriver`, `SoundDeviceInputDriver` (hardware audio capture via sounddevice with dropped frame tracking), `VirtualAudioInputDriver` (in-memory mock generator with sine wave and silence streams), `BaseAudioOutputDriver`, `SoundDeviceOutputDriver` (hardware speaker playback with immediate DAC queue abort), `VirtualAudioOutputDriver` (mock sink), and `VirtualAudioDriver` (composite test driver).
- `jarvis/audio/vad.py` (282 lines): Implements `BaseVADEngine`, `EnergyVADEngine` (RMS energy with zero external dependencies), `SileroONNXVADEngine` (ONNX recurrent classifier with `(2, 1, 64)` hidden states and automatic RMS fallback), and `VADSegmenter` (maintains 160ms pre-speech ring buffer, min-speech click filter, and 500ms trailing silence utterance endpointing).
- `jarvis/audio/stt.py` (231 lines): Implements `TranscriptionSegment`, `TranscriptionResult`, `BaseSTTEngine`, `FasterWhisperSTTEngine` (CTranslate2 Whisper integration with Romanian, English, and bilingual prompt biasing), and `MockSTTEngine` (deterministic transcriber with Romanian and English auto-detection and custom handler support).
- `jarvis/audio/chunker.py` (151 lines): Implements `TextNormalizer` (technical expansions for frequencies e.g. 24kHz, temperatures, %, and acronyms IoT, STT, TTS, VAD, OODA, API, DAC, WAL, CTE) and `SentenceChunker` (streaming token accumulator with clause splitting on `,`, `;`, `:` after 4 words and immediate sentence terminal splitting on `.`, `!`, `?` with abbreviation guards).
- `jarvis/audio/tts.py` (149 lines): Implements `BaseTTSEngine`, `KokoroTTSEngine` (24kHz ONNX neural synthesis loader with harmonic composite wave fallback), and `MockTTSEngine`.
- `jarvis/audio/bargein.py` (99 lines): Implements `BargeInController` (sub-50ms latency dispatch, DAC playback abort, `CancellationToken` cancellation, and speech queue purging with resilient callback execution).
- `jarvis/audio/pipeline.py` (275 lines): Implements `VoiceState` (`IDLE`, `LISTENING`, `THINKING`, `SPEAKING`, `INTERRUPTED`) and `AudioPipeline` integrating the complete cascade with `CognitiveExecutive`.

### 1.2 Test Execution Results
- **Full Test Suite (`pytest -v`)**:
  - Command: `python -m pytest -v`
  - Output: `189 passed in 3.18s` (100% pass rate).
- **Multi-Tier E2E Runner (`test_runner.py --tier all`)**:
  - Command: `python tests/e2e/test_runner.py --tier all`
  - Output: `Overall Status: PASSED (100% Pass Rate)` across Tiers 1-4 in 2.40s.
- **Independent Adversarial Stress Verification (`verify_m2.py`)**:
  - Streaming TTFB: **135.29ms** (SLA: <300ms).
  - VAD Trailing Silence Endpointing: Triggered at **512ms** (16 frames * 32ms >= 500ms threshold).
  - Multi-threaded Barge-In Stress: 200 concurrent interruptions across 10 threads completed in **3.23ms** (average **0.016ms** per trigger, SLA: <50ms).
  - STT Auto-detection: Verified 100% accuracy on Romanian domain prompts ("Salut Jarvis, aprinde lumina in birou", "Care este starea senzorilor?") and English prompts.
  - Ring buffer safety: Verified over **2.56M samples** across 5,000 continuous writes with zero memory growth or leaks.

## 2. Logic Chain

1. **Streaming Latency (<300ms TTFB)**:
   - `SentenceChunker` breaks LLM token deltas at clause punctuation (`,`, `;`, `:`) as soon as 4 words accumulate, rather than waiting for full multi-sentence completion.
   - `KokoroTTSEngine.synthesize_stream()` processes these clause chunks concurrently while downstream tokens are still being generated.
   - Measured TTFB under simulated token delivery is 135ms, comfortably beating the <300ms requirement.

2. **VAD 500ms Silence Endpointing**:
   - `VADSegmenter` processes 512-sample frames (32ms at 16kHz).
   - Trailing silence counter triggers completion when `silence_ms >= 500.0` (16 frames = 512ms).
   - Pre-speech ring buffer preserves 160ms (5 frames) of onset audio so plosives/consonants are not clipped.

3. **Sub-50ms Barge-In Interruption Guarantee**:
   - `BargeInController.trigger_bargein()` executes synchronously under a thread lock.
   - It invokes `output_driver.abort_playback()` (<1ms), signals `CancellationToken.cancel()`, purges `tts_queue`, and invokes callbacks safely.
   - Measured dispatch latency is <0.02ms in memory (spec allows up to 50ms).

4. **Integrity & Code Quality**:
   - No hardcoded test responses or facade bypasses exist.
   - All modules feature complete type annotations, docstrings, and robust error handling.
   - Fallbacks operate gracefully in headless/CPU environments when physical hardware or ONNX models are absent.

---

## 3. Caveats

- **Hardware Audio Devices in Headless CI**: In environments without physical soundcards, `SoundDeviceInputDriver` and `SoundDeviceOutputDriver` raise `AudioDeviceNotFoundError` if instantiated with real hardware flags; the architecture correctly defaults to `VirtualAudioDriver` or auto-detection to ensure 100% testability across all platforms.
- **ONNX Model Weights**: The test suite uses high-fidelity harmonic wave synthesis fallbacks when large ONNX weight files (`silero_vad.onnx`, `kokoro-v0_19.onnx`) are not pre-downloaded, ensuring offline CI execution without external network dependencies.

## 4. Conclusion

**Verdict: APPROVE**

The Milestone 2 implementation for the Cascaded Audio Pipeline & Barge-In ("Creier Vorbitor") meets all functional, architectural, performance, and integrity requirements. All 189 tests pass with 0 errors, 0 warnings, and zero memory leaks.

## 5. Verification Method

To independently reproduce and verify this review:

1. **Run full unit & integration test suite**:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain
   python -m pytest -v
   ```
   *Expected*: `189 passed in ~3s`.

2. **Run E2E test runner**:
   ```powershell
   python tests/e2e/test_runner.py --tier all
   ```
   *Expected*: `Overall Status: PASSED (100% Pass Rate)`.

3. **Run Reviewer 2 Adversarial Stress Verification**:
   ```powershell
   python C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\reviewer_m2_2\verify_m2.py
   ```
   *Expected*: All 5 stress tests report `[PASS]` and confirm TTFB < 150ms, Barge-in < 0.05ms, and 100% language auto-detection accuracy.
