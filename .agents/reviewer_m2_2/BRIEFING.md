# BRIEFING — 2026-08-27T19:51:00Z

## Mission
Objective and adversarial review of Milestone 2 (Cascaded Audio Pipeline & Barge-In) for Jarvis Cognitive Brain project.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: reviewer_critic
- Roles: reviewer, critic
- Working directory: C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\reviewer_m2_2
- Original parent: 0bbc34c1-eddc-44cf-8e9e-c4d23195d41e
- Milestone: Milestone 2 (Cascaded Audio Pipeline & Barge-In)
- Instance: Reviewer 2 of 2

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Actively check for integrity violations (no cheats, hardcoded outputs, dummy logic)
- Stress-test assumptions and find failure modes

## Current Parent
- Conversation ID: 0bbc34c1-eddc-44cf-8e9e-c4d23195d41e

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**: jarvis/audio/*, jarvis/config.py, jarvis/core/context.py, tests/unit/test_audio_pipeline.py, tests/unit/test_bargein.py, tests/e2e/*
- **Interface contracts**: AudioEngine & BargeInController in PROJECT.md
- **Review criteria**: correctness, latency (<300ms TTFB), VAD 500ms threshold, sub-50ms Barge-In, Romanian/English STT detection, resource leaks, edge cases

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**: jarvis/audio/drivers.py, jarvis/audio/vad.py, jarvis/audio/stt.py, jarvis/audio/chunker.py, jarvis/audio/tts.py, jarvis/audio/bargein.py, jarvis/audio/pipeline.py, tests/unit/*, tests/e2e/*
- **Verdict**: APPROVE
- **Unverified claims**: None. All claims verified independently via execution.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**: Streaming TTFB under 300ms, VAD 500ms silence threshold endpointing, 200 concurrent multithreaded barge-in triggers, NaN/Inf frame sanitization, 2.56M sample ring buffer overflow safety, Romanian and English STT auto-detection.
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None. All edge cases and boundary conditions are handled gracefully.
- **Untested angles**: Physical GPU CUDA acceleration during live microphone stream (headlessly simulated via virtual driver and CPU fallbacks).

## Key Decisions Made
- Confirmed full compliance with Milestone 2 specifications.
- Verified 189/189 test suite pass rate with 0 failures and 0 warnings.
- Issued formal APPROVE verdict.
