# BRIEFING — 2026-08-15T02:26:00Z

## Mission
Investigate Milestone 5: Continual Learning & Confidence Gating (`cognitive_core/learning.py`, `ContinualLearningGuard`, anchor memories, catastrophic forgetting prevention, confidence promotion gating to `very_high` requiring `source_type="execution"`, test coverage and edge cases).

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: Teamwork Explorer
- Roles: Read-only investigator, synthesizer
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\explorer_m5_1
- Original parent: 4b331fbc-eb8c-41a5-8ea8-e64218064557
- Milestone: Milestone 5 (Continual Learning & Confidence Gating)

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Read-only investigation — do NOT implement
- Do NOT modify source code files
- Preserve all findings in report.md and handoff.md
- Send message back to parent agent upon completion

## Investigation State
- **Explored paths**: `cognitive_core/learning.py`, `cognitive_core/tests/test_continual_learning.py`, `cognitive_core/tests/test_learning.py`, `cognitive_core/tests/test_tool_router_security.py`, `memory_controller/tests/test_milestone3_empirical_challenge.py`, `cognitive_core/executive.py`, `cognitive_core/evaluation.py`, `memory_controller/controller.py`.
- **Key findings**:
  - `ContinualLearningGuard` correctly registers replay anchors and detects deleted anchor memories.
  - Line 37-39 missing check for demoted verification status or content drift documented as an edge case.
  - `LearningEngine.promote_memories` strictly requires `source_type="execution"` and 9+ relations for `very_high` confidence promotion.
  - Non-execution provenance is strictly rejected from `very_high` confidence.
  - Promoted notes receive `verification="partially_verified"` (never `verified`).
  - 100% test pass: 186/186 cognitive core tests pass, 5/5 learning tests pass.
- **Unexplored areas**: None for Milestone 5 continual learning scope.

## Key Decisions Made
- Completed full read-only investigation and test execution.
- Generated `report.md` and `handoff.md`.
