# BRIEFING — 2026-08-27T19:32:00Z

## Mission
Adversarial Stress Testing & Correctness verification for Milestone 1 (Jarvis Cognitive Brain: OODA loop, LLM streaming, Reflexion, Checkpoints).

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: EMPIRICAL CHALLENGER
- Roles: critic, specialist
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\challenger_m1_1
- Original parent: 5a625f23-4992-4b00-bb13-1f4b316b216c
- Milestone: Milestone 1 (OODA loop, LLM streaming, Reflexion, Checkpoints)
- Instance: 1 of 1

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only regarding production architecture design — do NOT modify production implementation code unless agreed, but write rigorous adversarial tests under projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/tests/ or test harnesses.
- Must execute verification code empirical run (run_command / pytest).
- Report verdict: APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES.

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**:
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/core/executive.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/core/ooda.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/core/models.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/llm/base.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/sqlite_engine.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/reflection.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/consolidation.py`
- **Review criteria**:
  - Rapid cancellation token triggers mid-stream
  - Corrupted / malformed perception events
  - Error recovery with simulated tool failures triggering 6-stage Reflexion
  - Checkpoint recovery from partial / corrupt wm.json and plan.json files
  - Robustness under stress and concurrency

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  1. Mid-stream token cancellation halting within ≤1 token window -> CONFIRMED PASS
  2. Empty / whitespace sensory payloads causing OODA crashes -> CONFIRMED SAFE
  3. Massive / repetitive queries triggering SQL expression tree overflow -> CONFIRMED BUG in search_bm25
  4. Prompt injection attempting to forge privileged provenance -> CONFIRMED INVARIANT GATED
  5. Multi-step failure triggering 6-stage Reflexion and lesson consolidation -> CONFIRMED PASS
  6. Corrupted JSON syntax / 0-byte checkpoint files -> CONFIRMED HANDLED
  7. Non-list JSON in wm.json poisoning WorkingMemory -> CONFIRMED BUG in WorkingMemory.load_state
- **Vulnerabilities found**:
  - `SQLiteStorageEngine.search_bm25`: Unbounded query token expansion causes `sqlite3.OperationalError: Expression tree is too large (maximum depth 1000)`.
  - `WorkingMemory.load_state`: Assigns unvalidated JSON directly to `active_chunks`, causing `AttributeError` on subsequent operations if `wm.json` is a dict.
- **Untested angles**:
  - Live audio hardware drivers (scheduled for Milestone 2).
  - Live Home Assistant network socket integration (scheduled for Milestone 4).

## Loaded Skills
- **Source**: vault-operations, vault-security-audit, unit-test-generation-contract
- **Local copy**: None needed
- **Core methodology**: Adversarial fuzzing, empirical oracle testing, race condition checking, corrupted state injection.

## Key Decisions Made
- Implemented comprehensive adversarial test suite in `tests/unit/test_adversarial_m1.py`.
- Formulated verdict: `REQUEST_CHANGES` due to 2 confirmed vulnerabilities.

- `.agents/challenger_m1_1/progress.md` — Liveness & task tracker
- `.agents/challenger_m1_1/handoff.md` — Final 5-component handoff report
