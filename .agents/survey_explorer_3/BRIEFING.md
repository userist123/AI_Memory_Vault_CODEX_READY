# BRIEFING — 2026-08-25T19:29:20Z

## Mission
Comprehensive survey and analysis of test infrastructure, test suites (518 passing tests), test runner conventions, database isolation, SQLite WAL concurrency, P0-P18 invariant testing, audit log validation, and test plan definition for R1-R4 of the Financial Research & Trading Journal System.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: explorer
- Roles: test-architect, quality-assurance, security-auditor, codebase-investigator
- Working directory: C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\survey_explorer_3
- Original parent: fe349d87-bb77-42da-8379-001833bc54af
- Milestone: Survey & Architectural Design (Explorer Phase)

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Read-only investigation — do NOT implement
- Analyze existing tests, invariants, test isolation, and test runner configurations
- Deliver comprehensive `analysis.md` and `handoff.md` in working directory
- Communicate completion and findings back to parent via `send_message`

## Current Parent
- Conversation ID: fe349d87-bb77-42da-8379-001833bc54af
- Updated: 2026-08-25T19:29:20Z

## Investigation State
- **Explored paths**:
  - `memory_controller/tests/` (21 test modules, 206 tests)
  - `cognitive_core/tests/` (47 test modules, 292 tests)
  - `xau_kinetic/tests/` (8 test modules, 20 tests)
  - `memory_controller/storage/sqlite_engine.py` (WAL mode, `busy_timeout=5000`, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, recursive CTE)
  - `memory_controller/audit/logger.py` (SHA-256 tamper-evident hash chaining)
  - `memory_controller/controller.py` (P0-P15 invariants, `Principal` authorization, lifecycle gates)
  - `xau_kinetic/infrastructure/persistence.py` & `xau_kinetic/tools/verify_audit_log.py`
  - `C:\Users\Marius\Desktop\Nu sterge\nusterge\ghid.py` (FRED API, yfinance, indicators)
- **Key findings**:
  - Total 518 tests across 76 modules execute in ~10.6s with 100% pass rate.
  - SQLite WAL mode and `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transactions provide deterministic write isolation and zero database corruption under high-concurrency stress.
  - Invariants P0-P18 and SHA-256 audit chaining are thoroughly covered by adversarial test suites.
  - Complete test architecture and test plans defined for R1 (Ingestion), R2 (Memory Controller & Search), R3 (Trading Journal & Research), and R4 (Audit & Anti-Regression).
- **Unexplored areas**: None within survey scope.

## Key Decisions Made
- Cataloged complete 518-test suite inventory and execution characteristics.
- Structured test plans for R1-R4 matching requirements from `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`.
- Authored detailed `analysis.md` and 5-component `handoff.md`.

## Artifact Index
- `DISPATCH.md` — Task dispatch log
- `BRIEFING.md` — Persistent working memory and identity
- `progress.md` — Liveness heartbeat and milestone tracker
- `analysis.md` — Detailed survey of test infrastructure & test architecture design
- `handoff.md` — 5-component self-contained handoff report
