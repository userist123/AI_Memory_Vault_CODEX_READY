# BRIEFING — 2026-08-28T14:07:00Z

## Mission
Independent adversarial security and compliance review of Milestone 3: ScopedStorageProxy, Verifier Agent, least privilege enforcement, and MultiAgentSupervisor orchestration.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: reviewer_critic
- Roles: reviewer, critic
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\reviewer_m3_2
- Original parent: 8b531079-7cca-4ec6-a0e3-4ce625943430
- Milestone: Milestone 3
- Instance: 1 of 1

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Evidence-based review and adversarial challenge
- Check for integrity violations (hardcoding, dummies, bypasses, fabricated logs)

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**: `jarvis/agents/base.py`, `jarvis/agents/verifier.py`, `jarvis/agents/supervisor.py`, `jarvis/agents/router.py`, `jarvis/agents/retrieval.py`, `jarvis/agents/consolidator.py`, `jarvis/agents/critic.py`, `tests/unit/test_agent_least_privilege.py`, and test suites.
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `vault_cognitive_rules.md`, `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`
- **Review criteria**: P0-P18 Invariant conformance, least privilege scoping, cyclic supersession rejection, absence of integrity violations, test suite green

## Key Decisions Made
- Confirmed compliance with Invariants P0-P18 in `ScopedStorageProxy` and `VerifierAgent`.
- Identified 3 critical concurrency, cancellation, and retry defects in `MultiAgentSupervisor` causing test failures and worker pool hangs.
- Issued verdict: `REQUEST_CHANGES`.

## Artifact Index
- `.agents/reviewer_m3_2/DISPATCH.md` — Incoming dispatch log
- `.agents/reviewer_m3_2/BRIEFING.md` — Situational awareness
- `.agents/reviewer_m3_2/progress.md` — Liveness and progress
- `.agents/reviewer_m3_2/report.md` — Comprehensive review & challenge report
- `.agents/reviewer_m3_2/handoff.md` — 5-component handoff report

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**: `ScopedStorageProxy`, `VerifierAgent`, `RouterAgent`, `RetrievalAgent`, `ConsolidatorAgent`, `CriticAgent`, `MultiAgentSupervisor`, full pytest suite.
- **Verdict**: REQUEST_CHANGES
- **Unverified claims**: Worker claim of 100% clean test execution was falsified by deep adversarial stress tests revealing 3 supervisor defects.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  1. `AI_AGENT` cannot self-verify (P0-001) -> PASSED (Blocked)
  2. `AI_AGENT` cannot promote directly to `ACTIVE` (P0-004) -> PASSED (Blocked)
  3. `AI_AGENT` cannot claim privileged source types (P0-002) -> PASSED (Blocked)
  4. Cyclic/self supersession chains are rejected (P0-012/P0-013) -> PASSED (Blocked)
  5. In-flight task cancellation -> FAILED (`asyncio.CancelledError` kills worker coroutine)
  6. Task retry under multi-worker load -> FAILED (Duplicate dispatch race condition)
  7. Queue cancellation of pending tasks -> FAILED (Pending tasks still execute)
- **Vulnerabilities found**: 3 critical/major supervisor lifecycle defects.
