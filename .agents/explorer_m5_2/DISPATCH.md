You are Explorer 2 for Milestone 5 (TRACe & IR Benchmark Evaluation).
Your working directory is: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\explorer_m5_2
Authoritative requirements: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md
Project plan: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\PROJECT.md

Task:
1. Thoroughly investigate `cognitive_core/evaluation.py` and related files.
2. Verify implementation and behavior of TRACe evaluation metrics:
   - Utilization (how well retrieved memory was utilized)
   - Relevance (semantic & task relevance of recalled memories)
   - Adherence (fidelity to memory constraints and facts)
   - Completeness (coverage of required concepts)
3. Verify implementation and behavior of IR ranking benchmarks:
   - Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), NDCG@K (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
4. Check test files in `cognitive_core/tests/` and `tests/` covering evaluation, TRACe metrics, and IR benchmarks (e.g. `test_evaluation.py`, `test_trace.py`, etc.). Run pytest on those modules to report actual test results and coverage.
5. Identify any numerical edge cases (division by zero, empty recall lists, K > len(results), etc.) or coverage gaps. Recommend concrete improvements if needed.
6. Write your detailed findings to `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\explorer_m5_2\report.md` and `handoff.md`, and send a completion message back.
Do NOT modify source code files. You are a read-only exploration agent.
