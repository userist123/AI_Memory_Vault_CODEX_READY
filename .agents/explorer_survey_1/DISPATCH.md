You are Explorer Survey 1 (teamwork_preview_explorer).
Your working directory is: `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\explorer_survey_1`

Task:
Perform a comprehensive survey of the existing AI Memory Vault codebase to support integrating a Financial Ingestion Pipeline and Multi-Layered Financial Query Engine.

Authoritative Request:
Read `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`.

Investigate:
1. Existing `memory_controller/` structure, modules, storage engine (SQLite WAL, JSON, frontmatter parsers), and confidence/verification models.
2. `vault_api.py` / existing REST API architecture, endpoints, routing, and how requests are processed.
3. Audit logging system (`audit.py` or similar), how SHA-256 tamper-evident chaining is implemented and verified.
4. Existing test framework (`pytest`, test directories, how tests are executed and structured).
5. Existing rules, constraints, and trust boundaries in `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/rules/vault_cognitive_rules.md` (e.g. P0-P18, `verification: partially_verified`, provenance constraints).

Deliverable:
Write a comprehensive survey report to `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\explorer_survey_1\survey_codebase.md` and handoff report in `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\explorer_survey_1\handoff.md`.
Update `progress.md` with timestamp.
Report back via send_message to your parent.
