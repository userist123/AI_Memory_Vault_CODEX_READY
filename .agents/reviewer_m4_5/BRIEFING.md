# BRIEFING — 2026-08-15T02:21:15Z

## Mission
Conduct the definitive verification and adversarial review of Milestone 4 (Cognitive Loop & Multi-Agent Coordination), auditing verifier_agent.py, recall.py, reflection.py, security invariants P0-P15, and running the full pytest suite.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: reviewer_critic
- Roles: reviewer, critic
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\reviewer_m4_5
- Original parent: 4d8619ff-fda6-4c9e-8801-2dbe0fd86141
- Milestone: Milestone 4 (Cognitive Loop & Multi-Agent Coordination)
- Instance: 5 of 5

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Enforce strict integrity check (no hardcoded test results, facade logic, bypasses, fabricated outputs)
- Verify zero regressions against security invariants P0-P15
- Test full pytest suite independently

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**: `cognitive_core/agents/verifier_agent.py`, `cognitive_core/recall.py`, `cognitive_core/reflection.py`, and related modules (`cognitive_core/executive.py`, `cognitive_core/consolidation.py`, `cognitive_core/reasoning.py`, tests).
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`, `rules/vault_cognitive_rules.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- **Review criteria**: Correctness, completeness, adversarial robustness, security invariant preservation (P0-P15), code quality, test suite integrity.

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**:
  - `cognitive_core/agents/verifier_agent.py` (safe non-dict provenance handling & least privilege)
  - `cognitive_core/recall.py` (pre-penalty successor score inheritance with 10% freshness bonus)
  - `cognitive_core/reflection.py` (canonical relation schema and SelfRefine safe content handling)
  - Full pytest suite (`python -m pytest` across all 39 test modules)
  - Dedicated adversarial challenger test suite (`cognitive_core/tests/test_milestone4_adversarial_challenger_m4_5.py`)
  - Standalone verification probes (`probe_verifier.py`, `probe_recall.py`, `probe_reflection.py`, `probe_security.py`)
- **Verdict**: APPROVE
- **Unverified claims**: None. All claims independently verified through static inspection, isolated adversarial scripts, and repository-wide test execution.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**: 
  - Malformed provenance payloads (None, string, int, float, bool, list, nested invalid dicts) -> handled gracefully with violation flagging.
  - Successor score inheritance with single-hop, multi-hop (5-hop, 10-hop), branching graphs, historical queries, and score ceiling capping at 1.0 -> verified mathematically.
  - Reflection schema validation with empty, non-dict, non-string, short content, and missing node IDs -> verified resilient.
  - Security invariant violations (Principal.AI_AGENT self-verification, provenance forging, direct ACTIVE proposal, unauthorized attestation) -> all strictly blocked.
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None.
- **Untested angles**: None.

## Key Decisions Made
- Confirmed full passing status of 388 pytest test cases (0 failures, 40.46s).
- Verified zero integrity violations across all cognitive core and memory controller modules.
- Formulated APPROVE verdict for Milestone 4.
