# Teamwork Project Prompt — Draft

> Status: Launched
> Goal: Craft prompt → get user approval → delegate to teamwork_preview
> Requested team: Very large team of agents (as previously specified)

Integrate a financial data ingestion pipeline and a multi‑layered financial query engine into the AI Memory Vault (`AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY`). The system will ingest scripts and Excel files from `C:\Users\Marius\Desktop\Nu sterge\nusterge` (`ghid.py`, `Analiza_Piata_Profesionala.xlsx`), transform them into canonical financial notes, and expose search capabilities via the vault API.

Working directory: `C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY`
Integrity mode: development

## Requirements

### R1. Financial Ingestion Pipeline
- Process `ghid.py` and `Analiza_Piata_Profesionala.xlsx` to produce canonical financial notes adhering to the JSON‑Schema defined in `memory_controller/financial_schema.py`.
- Each note must contain valid front‑matter (`id`, `type`, `lifecycle`, `provenance`, `confidence`, `verification`).
- No hard‑coded secrets – API keys must be injected via environment variables.

### R2. Core Memory Controller & Multi‑Layered Query Engine
- Extend `memory_controller` with a `FinancialQueryEngine` exposing `ingest_financial_note` and `search` methods.
- Support layered retrieval: BM25 lexical search → tag/wikilink filtering → optional vector similarity (config‑gated).
- Expose REST‑like endpoints in `vault_api.py` (`POST /financial_note`, `GET /search`).

### R3. Verification & Quality Assurance
- Provide a suite of unit tests (`tests/financial/test_query_engine.py`, `tests/financial/test_schema.py`) covering ingestion, schema validation, BM25 search, and optional vector fallback.
- CI workflow must run all new tests and enforce secret‑leak detection.
- Audit log integrity (SHA‑256 tamper‑evidence) must remain intact.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Ingestion of a sample dataset creates at least one canonical note with `verification: partially_verified` and correct provenance.
- [ ] BM25 keyword search for a known symbol (e.g., "NASDAQ") returns the expected note.
- [ ] All new unit tests pass (`pytest -q tests/financial/` reports 0 failures).
- [ ] No secrets are present in any persisted notes or code.
- [ ] Audit log entries retain valid SHA‑256 hashes.

# Teamwork Project Prompt — Draft

> Status: Step 2 — Project description captured
> Goal: Craft prompt → get user approval → delegate to teamwork_preview
> Requested team: full team (design, development, QA)

**Project description**: Rebuild the OTP Flight Finder web application so that all airline deep‑links (especially Ryanair) strictly use Bucharest Henri Coandă (OTP) as the departure airport, eliminate any fallback to Băneasa (BBU), and ensure the UI/UX is polished using the appropriate design and development skills from the Vault.

Working directory: ~/teamwork_projects/otp_flight_finder

## Requirements

### R1. Strict OTP usage
All generated deep‑links for Ryanair (and other airlines) must include both `origin`/`originIata` and `destination`/`destinationIata` parameters set to the correct IATA codes, guaranteeing that the Ryanair booking page always opens with OTP selected.

### R2. UI/UX consistency
Apply the UI/UX design specifications that were produced by the `ui_ux_designer` skill (responsive layout, Tailwind palette, accessibility compliance) and integrate them into the static front‑end.

### R3. Verification suite
Provide an automated test suite (pytest) that validates:
- The Ryanair deep‑link opens with OTP pre‑selected.
- No BBU airport appears in any search results or links.
- All static assets load without UTF‑8 BOM issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Correct deep‑link behaviour
- [ ] Every Ryanair deep‑link generated by the API contains both `origin`/`originIata=OTP` and `destination`/`destinationIata` parameters.
- [ ] Manual testing of the “Rezervă” button on the live site confirms OTP is pre‑filled.

### UI quality
- [ ] The site passes Lighthouse audits with **Performance ≥ 90**, **Accessibility ≥ 90**, **Best Practices ≥ 90**, **SEO ≥ 90**.
- [ ] The design matches the `ui_ux_designer` specification (colors, layout, responsive breakpoints).

### Test coverage
- [ ] All new functionality is covered by automated tests (≥ 80 % line coverage).
- [ ] The test suite runs successfully on the CI pipeline without failures.

Building a local, fully autonomous, self-improving Cognitive Brain ("Creier Vorbitor") featuring a complete cognitive OODA loop (Observe, Retrieve, Reason, Plan, Act, Reflect, Consolidate), integrated with a real-time cascading audio pipeline (STT Silero VAD + Faster-Whisper, TTS Kokoro-82M with barge-in/AEC), multi-agent worker coordination, a local Home Assistant IoT REST API simulation, and an ultra-modern 3D Web HUD interface.

Working directory: `C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain`
Integrity mode: demo

## Requirements

### R1. Cognitive Loop Self-Execution & Memory Persistent Storage
Establish a local daemon utilizing the Google Antigravity SDK. Configured out-of-the-box to prioritize local LLMs (e.g., via Ollama running local models like `qwen2.5-coder`), but structured modularly to allow simple configuration-level swapping to external API models (Gemini API, Claude API, etc.) in the future. Implement a full stateful OODA cycle:
- **Observe**: Classify incoming vocal/text requests.
- **Retrieve**: Use associative and semantic recall to fetch context from an Obsidian-style markdown database and a persistent database.
- **Reason/Plan**: Formulate structured multi-step plans.
- **Act**: Route tool calls via FastMCP.
- **Reflect/Consolidate**: Run self-reflection (Reflexion) and store consolidated lessons back to the long-term memory.

### R2. Cascaded Audio Pipeline with Barge-in
Implement a high-performance audio engine:
- **STT**: Continuous audio capture with a Silero VAD classifier (500ms silence threshold) segmenting input for a local `faster-whisper` engine.
- **TTS**: Local text-to-speech synthesis using the `Kokoro-82M` model via ONNX.
- **Barge-in/AEC**: An immediate audio interruption mechanism that halts TTS output playback and cancels active LLM generation on VAD speech detection.

### R3. Multi-Agent Worker Orchestration
Coordinate execution using a supervisor and specialized, least-privilege agent workers (Router, Retrieval, Verifier, Consolidator, Critic) to process background tasks (e.g., gathering data, verifying memory compliance) without blocking the primary real-time voice loop.

### R4. FastMCP & IoT Home Assistant Integration
Implement a FastMCP tool server (`JarvisControls`) that provides validated tools to query and manipulate IoT device states over a local REST API (`/api/states`). Deliver a lightweight local simulator script to mock Home Assistant REST endpoints for reliable offline testing.

### R5. Ultra-Modern GUI Dashboard & Web HUD
Build a highly polished, responsive Web UI dashboard and 3D visualizer showing:
- Active vocal states (Idle, Listening, Thinking, Speaking) with dynamic sound reactivity.
- Visual representation of the active "thoughts" (OODA execution stages) and memory graphs/citations.
- System health meters and configuration settings.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Soundness & Integration
- [ ] Codebase compiles and runs cleanly under Python 3.12+.
- [ ] Cognitive OODA loop executes end-to-end, searching, planning, and updating the memory logs.
- [ ] Audio pipeline transcribes spoken queries and plays back responses under 300ms Time-To-First-Byte (TTFB) for synthesis.
- [ ] Barge-in events successfully halt active audio playback and interrupt ongoing LLM execution.
- [ ] Home Assistant simulated REST API accurately handles device state queries and command posts.
- [ ] The dashboard HUD visualizes voice states, OODA thoughts, and memory nodes without crashing.

RESUME INSTRUCTION: The project has completed Milestone 1 (Cognitive OODA loop & Memory persistent storage) and Milestone 2 (Cascaded Audio Pipeline with Silero VAD, Faster-Whisper, Kokoro-82M ONNX, and Barge-in/AEC). 235/235 tests are passing cleanly.
Your task is to resume execution starting from Milestone 3 (Multi-Agent Workers), Milestone 4 (FastMCP & IoT Home Assistant Integration), and Milestone 5 (Ultra-Modern 3D Web HUD Interface).
IMPORTANT: Ensure that the implementations of these milestones are written as actual production modules under the `jarvis/` directory (e.g. `jarvis/core/multi_agent.py`, `jarvis/tools/fastmcp.py`, `jarvis/iot/homeassistant.py`, `jarvis/hud/server.py`), rather than only existing in tests. Also, provide a main entry point script (e.g. `jarvis/main.py` or `run.py`) to launch the entire Cognitive Brain along with its audio pipeline, FastMCP server, HUD UI WebSocket server, and Home Assistant client.
