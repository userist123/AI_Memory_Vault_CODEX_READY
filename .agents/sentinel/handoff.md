# Sentinel Handoff — Jarvis Cognitive Brain ("Creier Vorbitor")

## Observation
- Received user request to build a local, fully autonomous, self-improving Cognitive Brain ("Creier Vorbitor").
- Target project working directory: `C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain`.
- Core requirements:
  - R1: Full cognitive OODA loop (Observe, Retrieve, Reason, Plan, Act, Reflect, Consolidate) with Google Antigravity SDK and local LLM prioritization (Ollama / `qwen2.5-coder`) with modular backend swapping.
  - R2: Cascaded audio pipeline (STT Silero VAD with 500ms silence threshold + Faster-Whisper, TTS Kokoro-82M ONNX, Barge-in/AEC interruption).
  - R3: Multi-agent worker orchestration (Supervisor + least-privilege workers: Router, Retrieval, Verifier, Consolidator, Critic).
  - R4: FastMCP tool server (`JarvisControls`) for IoT device state management over local REST API (`/api/states`) with Home Assistant lightweight simulator.
  - R5: Ultra-modern GUI dashboard and 3D Web HUD (vocal states: Idle, Listening, Thinking, Speaking, dynamic audio reactivity, OODA thought visualizer, memory graphs, system health).

## Logic Chain
1. Preserved exact user prompt verbatim in `.agents/ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md` and root `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`.
2. Evaluated routing table: Complex multi-component software engineering project -> routed to `teamwork_preview_orchestrator` (General Path).
3. Created working directory `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\orchestrator_jarvis` and project directory `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain`.
4. Dispatched Project Orchestrator subagent (ID: `5a625f23-4992-4b00-bb13-1f4b316b216c`).
5. Activated Progress Reporting cron (`*/8 * * * *`, task: `task-35`) and Liveness Check cron (`*/10 * * * *`, task: `task-37`).

## Caveats
- Must run cleanly under Python 3.12+.
- Audio pipeline must deliver sub-300ms TTFB for synthesis.
- Barge-in must immediately halt active playback and cancel ongoing LLM generation.
- Victory Auditor (`teamwork_preview_victory_auditor`) is MANDATORY before reporting project completion.

## Conclusion
- Orchestrator dispatched and active. Monitoring crons running. Sentinel in reactive observation mode.

## Verification Method
- Periodic progress monitoring via scheduled crons.
- Independent victory audit verification upon completion claim.
