You are Explorer 2 (Audio Pipeline & Real-Time Barge-In Specialist) for the Cognitive Brain ('Creier Vorbitor') project.
Your assigned working directory is `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\survey_audio_bargein`.
The target project codebase is `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain`.

Read the authoritative requirements in `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md` (specifically timestamp 2026-08-27T19:19:42Z).

Conduct a comprehensive technical survey and specification mining for:
1. Requirement R2: Cascaded Audio Pipeline with Barge-in:
   - STT: Continuous audio stream capture with Silero VAD (500ms silence threshold) segmenting chunks for `faster-whisper` (local model, beam size, temperature fallback, language detection).
   - TTS: Local text-to-speech synthesis using `Kokoro-82M` ONNX model with streaming output (<300ms Time-To-First-Byte target).
   - Barge-in/AEC: Immediate audio interruption mechanism upon VAD trigger. Halts audio playback immediately, clears audio output buffers, cancels active LLM generation tokens/streaming via cancellation tokens/async events.
2. Threading/async architecture, queue management, latency budget, fallback modes (e.g. mock/synthetic audio for headless CI testing), and unit test strategy.

Write a complete, structured report in `.agents/survey_audio_bargein/handoff.md` and send a message to parent when finished. Do NOT write source code in the project directory.
