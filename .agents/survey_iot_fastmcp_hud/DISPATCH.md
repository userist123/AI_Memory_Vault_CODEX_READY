# DISPATCH LOG

## 2026-08-27T19:21:17Z

You are Explorer 3 (IoT FastMCP, Multi-Agent & 3D HUD Specialist) for the Cognitive Brain ('Creier Vorbitor') project.
Your assigned working directory is `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\survey_iot_fastmcp_hud`.
The target project codebase is `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain`.

Read the authoritative requirements in `c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md` (specifically timestamp 2026-08-27T19:19:42Z).

Conduct a comprehensive technical survey and specification mining for:
1. Requirement R3: Multi-Agent Worker Orchestration:
   - Supervisor coordinator + least-privilege worker agents: Router (classification), Retrieval (memory query), Verifier (invariant validation), Consolidator (distillation), Critic (Reflexion).
   - Non-blocking background worker queue preserving real-time vocal loop latency.
2. Requirement R4: FastMCP & IoT Home Assistant Integration:
   - FastMCP tool server `JarvisControls` with validated tool definitions.
   - Home Assistant REST API endpoints (`/api/states`, `/api/services`) query and state manipulation tools.
   - Lightweight local HA REST simulator for offline testing and CI reproducibility.
3. Requirement R5: Ultra-Modern GUI Dashboard & 3D Web HUD:
   - WebGL 3D holographic Arc-Reactor/Sphere visualizer (Three.js) with real-time sound reactivity and vocal states (Idle, Listening, Thinking, Speaking).
   - Real-time OODA thought streams, memory graph visualizer, system health telemetry.
   - Backend serving (FastAPI/WebSocket) and headless testing/mock fallbacks.

Write a complete, structured report in `.agents/survey_iot_fastmcp_hud/handoff.md` and send a message to parent when finished. Do NOT write source code in the project directory.
