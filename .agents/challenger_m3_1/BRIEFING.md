# BRIEFING — 2026-08-14T20:23:30Z

## Mission
Perform empirical adversarial stress testing on Milestone 3 Security Invariants (P0-P15), covering AI self-verification prevention, provenance integrity, lifecycle restrictions, attestation gating, zero partial writes on rejection, and tool router reconciliation boundary enforcement.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: challenger
- Roles: critic, specialist
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\challenger_m3_1
- Original parent: d4ac85d0-8437-44da-a1a0-09c9069218d5
- Milestone: M3 (Security Invariants & Attestation Gates)
- Instance: 1 of 1

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only & empirical testing — write test harnesses and adversarial scripts, execute them, and report findings.
- Do NOT modify production implementation code directly.
- NEVER place source code, tests, or data files in `.agents/`. All test suites go into standard project test directories (`memory_controller/tests/`, `cognitive_core/tests/`).

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**: `memory_controller/controller.py`, `memory_controller/authorizer.py`, `cognitive_core/tool_router.py`, `memory_controller/storage/sqlite_engine.py`, `memory_controller/storage/file_engine.py`, `memory_controller/audit/logger.py`
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `vault_cognitive_rules.md`
- **Review criteria**: P0-P15 Security Invariants, AI self-verification rejection, provenance forge rejection, post-creation immutability, human/admin attestation gating, zero partial writes in SQLite on failure, tool router security bounds.

## Key Decisions Made
- Created and executed dedicated adversarial test suite `memory_controller/tests/test_adversarial_p0_p15_invariants.py` with 11 comprehensive attack scenarios.
- Executed full test suite (292 tests passed across 38 modules), verifying 0 partial writes, SQL transaction rollbacks, and SHA-256 audit log integrity.
- Verified all P0-P15 security invariants hold against direct attacks, multithreaded contention, and tool router routing.

- `.agents/challenger_m3_1/BRIEFING.md` — Persistent working memory and situational awareness
- `.agents/challenger_m3_1/progress.md` — Liveness heartbeat and milestone progress tracker
- `.agents/challenger_m3_1/handoff.md` — 5-component handoff report and adversarial verdict
- `memory_controller/tests/test_adversarial_p0_p15_invariants.py` — Standalone adversarial test suite
- `memory_controller/tests/test_milestone3_empirical_challenge.py` — Multi-threaded attestation race and fuzzing suite

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  1. AI_AGENT proposes `verification="verified"` -> REJECTED with ValueError, 0 rows written in SQLite WAL.
  2. AI_AGENT forges `provenance.source_type` (`user`, `official`, `experience`, `import`) -> REJECTED with ValueError, 0 rows written.
  3. AI_AGENT or HUMAN/ADMIN mutates `provenance.source_type` post-creation -> REJECTED with ValueError, provenance remains unchanged.
  4. AI_AGENT proposes directly into `ACTIVE`, `VERIFIED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `ARCHIVED` -> REJECTED with ValueError, 0 rows written.
  5. AI_AGENT calls `controller.attest()` -> REJECTED with PermissionError.
  6. AI_AGENT attempts to mutate, archive, or supersede human-verified memories via `ToolRouter` -> REJECTED with ApprovalRequiredError.
  7. High-concurrency barrage (8 attacker threads, 4 writer threads, 4 reader threads) -> 0 partial writes, 100% of invalid writes fail, SQLite integrity check passes `ok`.
  8. Cryptographic audit log hash chain -> SHA-256 validation passes with 0 anomalies, tamper detection confirms breakage when modified.
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None. All attack vectors were successfully blocked and contained.
- **Untested angles**: None within Milestone 3 scope.
