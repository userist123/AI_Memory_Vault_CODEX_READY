Task:
Perform empirical adversarial stress testing on Milestone 3 Security Invariants (P0-P15).

Required reading:
1. c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md
2. c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\PROJECT.md
3. c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\AGENTS.md
4. c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\rules\vault_cognitive_rules.md
5. c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\worker_m3_1\handoff.md

Adversarial Objectives:
1. Create and execute adversarial attack scripts/test cases attempting to bypass P0-P15 invariants:
   - Attempting to propose notes with verification="verified" under Principal.AI_AGENT.
   - Attempting to forge provenance.source_type as "user" or "official" under Principal.AI_AGENT.
   - Attempting to update provenance.source_type post-creation.
   - Attempting to call controller.attest() as Principal.AI_AGENT.
   - Attempting to create notes directly into ACTIVE lifecycle as Principal.AI_AGENT.
   - Attempting to mutate verified canonical notes through tool router without authorization.
2. Verify that in all failure cases, 0 partial writes occur in SQLite storage (database state unchanged).
3. Run test suites and your adversarial harnesses.
4. Report detailed results and verdict (APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES) in handoff.md and send a message back to caller.
