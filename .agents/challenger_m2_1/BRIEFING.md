# BRIEFING — 2026-08-27T19:51:00Z

## Mission
Empirically stress-test and challenge Milestone 2 of Jarvis Cognitive Brain (Barge-In interruption, audio pipeline, CircularAudioBuffer, concurrency race conditions, malformed audio handling).

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: EMPIRICAL CHALLENGER
- Roles: critic, specialist
- Working directory: C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\challenger_m2_1
- Original parent: 0bbc34c1-eddc-44cf-8e9e-c4d23195d41e
- Milestone: Milestone 2 (Barge-In Interruption & Audio Pipeline)
- Instance: 1 of 2

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review/Challenger role — write independent adversarial stress tests and harnesses to verify claims empirically.
- Execute test scripts directly, capture stdout/stderr, do not assume success.
- Do NOT modify production code directly; findings and bugs must be documented with reproductions in handoff report.
- Deliver hard verdict (APPROVE / REJECT) based on empirical results.

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**: `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/audio/` (`bargein.py`, `drivers.py`, `pipeline.py`, `vad.py`, `stt.py`, `tts.py`, `chunker.py`)
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`
- **Review criteria**: Concurrency safety, cancellation latency & idempotency, buffer boundary integrity, audio sanitization, leak-free cancellation under load.

## Key Decisions Made
- Authored and executed 13 adversarial stress tests in `tests/unit/test_adversarial_m2_audio.py` covering 500-iteration barrages, multi-threaded storms, async jitter races, circular buffer wrapping, and malformed signals.
- Authored and executed empirical reproduction suite in `tests/unit/test_adversarial_m2_edge_bugs.py` uncovering 1 CRITICAL deadlock, 2 MEDIUM defects, and 1 LOW anomaly.
- Issued verdict: `REJECT (Remediation Required)` with exact line numbers and proposed fixes.

- `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/tests/unit/test_adversarial_m2_edge_bugs.py` — Empirical edge bugs repro suite

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**: 
  - Rapid barge-in barrage SLA (<50ms): PASSED (avg 0.0011ms, max 0.0129ms).
  - Multi-threaded concurrent cancellation: PASSED under non-reentrant conditions.
  - Reentrant callback safety in BargeInController: FAILED (Critical Deadlock confirmed).
  - Malformed audio sanitization (NaN/Inf/Clipping): PASSED for 1D/2D arrays; FAILED for 0-d scalar arrays (TypeError).
  - CircularAudioBuffer 2M-sample stream wrap & multi-threading: PASSED; FAILED on empty buffer off-by-one return.
  - AsyncQueue cross-thread put_nowait safety in AudioPipeline: FAILED (potential event loop race).
- **Vulnerabilities found**: 1 Critical, 2 Medium, 1 Low.
- **Untested angles**: Hardware sounddevice physical loopback with live microphone hardware (due to headless environment).

## Loaded Skills
- None required directly beyond test engineering and async Python concurrency.
