# Forensic Integrity Audit Report — Milestone 3: Multi-Agent Subsystem

**Work Product**: `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/agents/`
**Integrity Mode**: Demo (per `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`)
**Verdict**: **CLEAN**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

A comprehensive forensic integrity audit was conducted on Milestone 3 (`Multi-Agent Worker Orchestration & Specialized Roles`) of the Jarvis Cognitive Brain codebase.

All production files (`models.py`, `base.py`, `router.py`, `retrieval.py`, `verifier.py`, `consolidator.py`, `critic.py`, `supervisor.py`, `__init__.py`, `jarvis/core/multi_agent.py`) were forensically inspected for integrity violations, hardcoded test results, facade implementations, mock overrides, and security leaks. Empirical tests were executed to verify genuine runtime behavior and trust boundary enforcement.

**Integrity Verdict**: **CLEAN** — No evidence of hardcoded test bypasses, dummy facades, fabricated logs, or prohibited delegation was detected. All classes implement authentic, genuine domain logic.

## 2. Integrity Forensics Phase Results

| # | Check Name | Mode Enforcement | Status | Empirical Evidence / Finding |
|---|------------|------------------|:------:|------------------------------|
| 1 | **Hardcoded Test Results Detection** | Demo / Dev / Benchmark | **PASS** | Grep & AST analysis across `jarvis/agents/` revealed zero hardcoded test assertions, expected output literals, or lookup tables tailored to bypass test suites. |
| 2 | **Facade & Dummy Implementation Detection** | Demo / Dev / Benchmark | **PASS** | Zero empty function stubs, `pass`, or `NotImplementedError` placeholders. All 8 modules implement genuine algorithmic logic (regex intent decomposition, multi-signal scoring, CTE recursive lineage resolution, 6-stage Reflexion, and priority heap scheduling). |
| 3 | **Mock Overrides in Production Code** | Demo / Dev / Benchmark | **PASS** | Production modules under `jarvis/agents/` contain zero mock classes, monkeypatches, or test harness overrides. |
| 4 | **Pre-Populated Artifact & Log Fabrication** | Demo / Dev / Benchmark | **PASS** | Workspace inspection confirmed zero pre-populated `.log` or attestation files prior to auditor execution. |
| 5 | **Execution Delegation to Prohibited Tools** | Demo | **PASS** | All agent logic executes natively in Python without delegating core work to unauthorized external scripts or black-box binaries. |
| 6 | **Trust Boundary & Invariant Enforcement (P0-P18)** | Demo | **PASS** | `ScopedStorageProxy` strictly enforces `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` matrix, rejecting unauthorized operations with `PermissionError`. VerifierAgent enforces RFC-4122 UUID validation, NoteType/Lifecycle enums, AI self-verification locks (P0-001), proposal creation lifecycle gating (P0-004), forbidden provenance checks (P0-002), and acyclic supersession rules (P0-012/P0-013). |
| 7 | **Secret & Credential Leak Audit** | Demo | **PASS** | Zero hardcoded API keys, tokens, or credentials in production code. `CriticAgent.critique_draft` includes active regex auditing and redaction for OpenAI (`sk-`), GitHub (`ghp_`), and private key patterns. |

## 4. Deep Adversarial Quality & Concurrency Findings

While the codebase is **CLEAN** of integrity violations and passes the targeted functional test suite (50/50 tests passing), adversarial stress testing by the challenger suite uncovered 3 concurrency and error isolation defects in `jarvis/agents/supervisor.py`:

### Finding 1: `asyncio.CancelledError` Worker Termination & Orphaned Task Future
- **Location**: `jarvis/agents/supervisor.py:166-195` (`_worker_loop`) and `230-324` (`_dispatch`)
- **Vulnerability**: In Python 3.8+, `asyncio.CancelledError` inherits from `BaseException`, not `Exception`. In `_dispatch`, only `except Exception:` and `except asyncio.TimeoutError:` are handled. When a running task is cancelled via its coroutine, `CancelledError` bypasses `_dispatch` error handling without calling `_record_completion`. This leaves the task's `Future` in `_task_futures` unresolved (causing `asyncio.gather(*futures)` to hang indefinitely) and terminates the worker coroutine in `_worker_loop`.
- **Reproduced in**: `tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_cancellation.py`

### Finding 2: Duplicate Dispatch on Task Retry
- **Location**: `jarvis/agents/supervisor.py:296-309` (`_dispatch`)
- **Vulnerability**: When a task with `max_retries > 0` fails, `_dispatch` places the task back onto `_async_queue` (`self._async_queue.put_nowait(...)`) AND immediately executes `return await self._dispatch(task)` on the current worker. This causes two worker coroutines to execute the retried task simultaneously.
- **Reproduced in**: `tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_retry.py`

### Finding 3: Execution of Cancelled Pending Tasks in Queue
- **Location**: `jarvis/agents/supervisor.py:352-376` (`cancel_tasks_matching`)
- **Vulnerability**: `cancel_tasks_matching` cancels futures and removes items from `self.queue`, but items already queued in `self._async_queue` without an explicit `CancellationToken` are still popped and executed by workers when they become available.
- **Reproduced in**: `tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_pending_cancel.py`

## 5. Audit Conclusion

The Milestone 3 Multi-Agent Subsystem work product satisfies all forensic integrity requirements under Demo Mode. It contains genuine, production-grade architecture without cheating or facade shortcuts. The 3 identified concurrency/cancellation edge cases are documented for quality hardening in subsequent worker iterations.

**Final Verdict**: **CLEAN**
