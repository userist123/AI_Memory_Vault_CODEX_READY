# BRIEFING — 2026-08-14T23:10:47Z

## Mission
Conduct an independent review and adversarial verification of Milestone 4 post-remediation, verifying overall cognitive loop stability, P0-P15 trust boundaries, and full test suite execution.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: reviewer-critic
- Roles: reviewer, critic
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\reviewer_m4_4
- Original parent: 4d8619ff-fda6-4c9e-8801-2dbe0fd86141
- Milestone: Milestone 4 (Cognitive Loop & Multi-Agent Coordination)
- Instance: 4 of 4

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Report any failures as findings; do NOT fix them yourself
- Objectively verify claims with execution and tests
- Adversarially stress-test assumptions and check integrity violations
- Issue explicit verdict (APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES)

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**:
  - `cognitive_core/` (OODA loop, ToT reasoning, freshness boost in recall, 6-stage Reflexion, SelfRefine, subagents)
  - `cognitive_core/reflection.py`
  - `cognitive_core/reasoning.py`
  - `cognitive_core/recall.py`
  - `cognitive_core/executive.py`
  - `cognitive_core/agents/`
  - `memory_controller/` P0-P15 security invariants
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`, `.agents/rules/vault_cognitive_rules.md`
- **Review criteria**: correctness, security invariants P0-P15, stability, full test suite pass rate

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**:
  - `cognitive_core/reflection.py` (Worker M4-2 fixes for `propose_synapse` schema isolation and `SelfRefine` type safety) -> VERIFIED
  - `cognitive_core/reasoning.py` (ToT multi-branch hypothesis generation and ThoughtValidator lexical grounding) -> VERIFIED
  - `cognitive_core/executive.py` (OODA loop, checkpointing, replanning, dynamic synapse firing) -> VERIFIED
  - `cognitive_core/agents/` (Least-privilege worker subagents) -> REVIEWED (Finding on `VerifierAgent` non-dict provenance)
  - `cognitive_core/recall.py` (Multi-signal scoring and freshness boost) -> REVIEWED (Finding on post-penalty freshness boost calculation)
  - `memory_controller/` (P0-P15 security invariants, WAL, SHA-256 audit chaining) -> VERIFIED (100% compliant)
- **Verdict**: REQUEST_CHANGES
- **Unverified claims**: None

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - AI self-verification and privileged provenance forgery -> Blocked (Pass)
  - Dynamic synapse schema compatibility and verification escalation bypass -> Pass
  - SelfRefine malformed, prompt-injected, and non-string inputs -> Pass
  - VerifierAgent corrupted/non-dict provenance payloads -> Attribute error (Vulnerability Found)
  - RecallEngine deep supersession lineage score inheritance -> Premature down-ranking (Vulnerability Found)
- **Vulnerabilities found**:
  - Vulnerability 1: `VerifierAgent.process_task` throws `AttributeError` when `node['provenance']` is not a dict.
  - Vulnerability 2: `RecallEngine.recall` computes the 10% freshness bonus on the already down-ranked superseded score (`0.3 * score`) rather than the unpenalized match score.
- **Untested angles**: None.

## Key Decisions Made
- Confirmed zero integrity violations (no hardcoded cheats, facades, or bypassed logic).
- Issued verdict of `REQUEST_CHANGES` due to 2 concrete findings surfaced via adversarial fuzzing and deep lineage probing.

## Artifact Index
- `.agents/reviewer_m4_4/BRIEFING.md` — persistent working memory
- `.agents/reviewer_m4_4/progress.md` — liveness heartbeat
- `.agents/reviewer_m4_4/handoff.md` — final 5-component handoff report
