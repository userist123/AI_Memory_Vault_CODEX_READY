# BRIEFING — 2026-08-14T23:02:40+03:00

## Mission
Thoroughly explore the existing Cognitive Brain system codebase, evaluate subsystem implementation status against requirements, identify strengths, gaps, bugs, and produce structured analysis and handoff reports.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: explorer
- Roles: Codebase Architect Explorer, Read-only investigator
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\survey_codebase_explorer_1
- Original parent: e71a16ec-5ebc-4ca2-ab0f-6beddef86e94
- Milestone: Codebase Architecture Survey & Analysis Complete

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Read-only investigation — do NOT implement / modify source code directly (only write reports and metadata in working directory).
- All handoffs must follow the 5-component format (Observation, Logic Chain, Caveats, Conclusion, Verification Method).
- Output must strictly follow the source of truth hierarchy and invariant checks (P0-P15).

## Current Parent
- Conversation ID: e71a16ec-5ebc-4ca2-ab0f-6beddef86e94
- Updated: 2026-08-14T23:02:40+03:00

## Investigation State
- **Explored paths**:
  - `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`
  - `memory_controller/` (storage, audit, authority, authorizer, security, controller, validation, context, cache, git)
  - `cognitive_core/` (executive, orchestrator, agents, reasoning, planning, reflection, recall, consolidation, deduplication, learning, evaluation, activation, attention, semantic, synapse, version, working_memory)
  - Test suites: 197 tests across `cognitive_core/tests/` and `memory_controller/tests/`
  - Skills and operating rules (`AGENTS.md`, `vault_cognitive_rules.md`, `vault-operations`, `vault-security-audit`)
- **Key findings**:
  - All 197 tests pass with 0 failures.
  - Subsystems for SQLite WAL storage, atomic persistence, OODA cognitive loop, security boundaries P0-P15, multi-agent workers, TRACe/IR metrics, and ContinualLearningGuard are fully implemented and verified.
  - Two missing `Tuple` imports detected in `cognitive_core/learning.py` and `cognitive_core/reflection.py`.
  - `audit_log.jsonl` has 4,694 legacy unhashed entries causing full-file `verify_integrity()` check to fail on legacy entries (760 recent hashed entries are verified valid).
  - Dead duplicate code block identified in `memory_controller/context/budget.py` (lines 135-175).
- **Unexplored areas**: None. Full codebase and tests surveyed.

## Key Decisions Made
- Completed static AST and runtime type hint evaluations across all modules.
- Evaluated both FileStorageEngine and SQLiteStorageEngine implementations.
- Assessed full multi-agent orchestration and security invariant matrices.

## Artifact Index
- DISPATCH.md — Initial dispatch log
- BRIEFING.md — Persistent context & state tracking
- progress.md — Heartbeat progress log
- report.md — Comprehensive architecture analysis report
- handoff.md — Formal 5-component handoff report
