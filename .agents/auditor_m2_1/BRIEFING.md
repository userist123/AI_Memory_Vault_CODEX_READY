# BRIEFING — 2026-08-27T22:50:20Z

## Mission
Perform exhaustive forensic integrity audit on Milestone 2 (Cascaded Audio Pipeline, VAD, STT, TTS, Barge-in, Drivers) of the Jarvis Cognitive Brain project.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: forensic_auditor
- Roles: critic, specialist, auditor
- Working directory: C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\auditor_m2_1
- Original parent: 0bbc34c1-eddc-44cf-8e9e-c4d23195d41e
- Target: Milestone 2: Cascaded Audio Pipeline & Barge-In

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Audit-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Trust NOTHING — verify everything independently
- Integrity Mode: Demo Mode (as specified in ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md)
- Prohibited: Hardcoded test results, facade implementations, fabricated verification outputs, copying core logic, delegating core work to external tools, test reverse-engineering.

## Audit Scope
- **Work product**: `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/audio/` and related audio tests
- **Profile loaded**: General Project (Demo Mode)
- **Audit type**: forensic integrity check

## Audit Progress
- **Phase**: reporting
- **Checks completed**: [Source code static analysis, Facade and hardcoding detection, Pre-populated artifact detection, Behavioral test execution, Output & latency verification, Mock separation audit, Adversarial stress testing]
- **Checks remaining**: []
- **Findings so far**: CLEAN

## Key Decisions Made
- Checked ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md: Integrity Mode is Demo mode.
- Verified genuine implementations for all Milestone 2 production classes (`SileroONNXVADEngine`, `FasterWhisperSTTEngine`, `KokoroTTSEngine`, `SoundDeviceInputDriver`, `SoundDeviceOutputDriver`, `BargeInController`, `AudioPipeline`).
- Verified clean separation of mock engines and virtual drivers for headless CI testing.
- Benchmarked empirical barge-in dispatch latency across 1000 cycles (avg 0.0011ms, p99 0.0021ms, max 0.0122ms; target < 50ms).
- Executed 22 audio unit tests (100% pass) and 113 e2e tests (100% pass).

## Artifact Index
- `DISPATCH.md` — Assignment instructions
- `BRIEFING.md` — Persistent state index
- `progress.md` — Liveness & step progress tracking
- `handoff.md` — Final forensic audit report and verdict

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - Non-finite (NaN/Inf) audio frame injection into `RobustAudioSanitizer` -> PASSED (clean zero-replacement and [-1.0, 1.0] clamping).
  - 16-thread concurrent hammer on `BargeInController` -> PASSED (2600 triggers, 0 deadlocks/exceptions).
  - High latency / slow execution during barge-in -> PASSED (sub-0.015ms dispatch latency).
  - VAD trailing silence segmentation endpointing -> PASSED (endpoint triggers reliably after 500ms continuous silence).
  - Chunker punctuation and clause streaming under cancellation -> PASSED (immediate `CancellationError` and state transition to `INTERRUPTED`).
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None
- **Untested angles**: None within Milestone 2 scope

## Loaded Skills
- None required
