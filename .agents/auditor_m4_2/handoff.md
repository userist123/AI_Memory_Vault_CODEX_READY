# Handoff Report — Forensic Integrity Audit for Milestone 4 (auditor_m4_2)

## 1. Observation
- **Audit Target**: `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/iot/` (`fastmcp_server.py`, `ha_client.py`, `ha_simulator.py`, `homeassistant.py`), `jarvis/tools/fastmcp.py`, and test suites `tests/unit/test_fastmcp_iot.py`, `tests/unit/test_challenger_m4_stress.py`.
- **Static Inspection**:
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/iot/fastmcp_server.py:360-366`: `if not isinstance(payload, dict): return {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": None, "error": {"code": -32600, "message": "Invalid Request: expected JSON object"}}`.
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/iot/ha_client.py:89-112`: `safe_call_service` wraps pre-checks in `try...except Exception as exc: return {"status": "error", "error": str(exc)}` and iterates over `isinstance(entity_id, (list, tuple))`.
  - Zero hardcoded test return statements, zero empty facade stubs, and zero pre-populated test output logs or result artifacts.
- **Empirical Execution**:
  - Command: `python -m pytest -v` (and `python -m pytest -q`) in `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain`.
  - Result: `434 passed in 11.01s` across 22 test files (100% pass rate).
  - Stress check in `tests/unit/test_challenger_m4_stress.py`: 84/84 passed cleanly.

## 2. Logic Chain
1. Per the JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification Section 4, a request MUST be a JSON Object. In `fastmcp_server.py`, non-dict payloads (primitives, lists, malformed JSON) are caught before dictionary lookups and return standard JSON-RPC 2.0 error envelopes with code `-32600` or `-32700`.
2. In `ha_client.py`, `safe_call_service` validates `entity_id` types (`str`, `list`, `tuple`) and catches communication / simulation errors (including 401 Unauthorized `PermissionError`), returning structured failure payloads without crashing the calling process.
3. In `ha_simulator.py`, full in-memory state tracking, domain service routing, and scene transitions (`scene.movie_night`, `scene.good_morning`) are implemented with realistic timestamps and attribute tracking.
4. The full test suite of 434 tests runs and passes cleanly, verifying that no regressions were introduced to Milestones 1, 2, 3, or 4.

## 3. Caveats
- No caveats. Real-world network deployment to a live external Home Assistant instance requires configuring network credentials and base URLs, which is gated and mocked via `HomeAssistantSimulator` for 100% offline hermetic verification.

## 4. Conclusion
- **VERDICT: CLEAN**
- Milestone 4 deliverables satisfy all architecture contracts, JSON-RPC 2.0 specifications, error resilience criteria, and trust boundary invariants without any integrity violations.

## 5. Verification Method
To independently reproduce and verify this audit:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain
python -m pytest -v
```
**Expected Outcome**: 434 passed, 0 failed.
**Invalidation Condition**: Any test failure, unhandled crash on malformed JSON, or presence of hardcoded mock bypasses in production files.
