# BRIEFING — 2026-08-26T16:04:30Z

## Mission
Explore architecture and design for the Financial Ingestion Pipeline, Multi-Layered Financial Query Engine, REST API integration, and Verification Strategy for AI Memory Vault.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: teamwork_preview_explorer (Explorer Survey 3)
- Roles: explorer, analyst, architect
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\explorer_survey_3
- Original parent: e87bdef8-bfc1-4e8e-a965-ccd159cf02a1
- Milestone: Survey & Architectural Design for Financial Ingestion, Query Engine & Verification

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Read-only investigation — do NOT implement production source code changes directly
- Document comprehensive findings in `survey_financial_architecture.md`, `survey_query_engine.md`, and `handoff.md`
- Maintain Vault Cognitive Rules (P0-P18), Canonical Frontmatter, Source of Truth Hierarchy, and Zero Secret Leaks
- Report back via send_message to parent

## Investigation State
- **Explored paths**:
  - `C:\Users\Marius\Desktop\Nu sterge\nusterge\ghid.py` (95 assets, 5 macro tickers, 4 FRED series, 30 risks, formulas, secrets)
  - `C:\Users\Marius\Desktop\Nu sterge\nusterge\Analiza_Piata_Profesionala.xlsx` (Market overview, technical dashboards, risk matrices, trade journals)
  - `memory_controller/financial_schema.py` & `memory_controller/financial_query.py`
  - `memory_controller/financial_search.py` (5-layer engine, RRF, graph spreading activation, progressive disclosure, HMAC pagination)
  - `vault_api.py` (FastAPI endpoints, authentication, pagination)
  - `tests/financial/` (310 passed test cases, UUID validation and route fixes identified)
- **Key findings**:
  - Ingestion pipeline maps raw source artifacts to `06_INBOX/RAW_IMPORTS/financial/` with `lifecycle: RAW`, redacts API keys, uses AST/openpyxl extractors, and emits 7 types of canonical notes with Draft 7 frontmatter.
  - Multi-layered query engine operates via Entity Resolver -> SQLite structured filter -> Okapi BM25 + Vector Cosine RRF -> Wikilink graph spreading activation -> Progressive disclosure context packs.
  - `POST /financial_note` and `GET /search` contracts fully defined with Pydantic models, trust invariant checks, and error responses.
  - Test harness design in `tests/financial/` covers schema validation, BM25 matching for symbols like "NASDAQ", vector fallback toggles, deduplication, and CI secret leak prevention.
- **Unexplored areas**: None within scope.

## Key Decisions Made
- Architecture and design fully synthesized into `survey_financial_architecture.md`, `survey_query_engine.md`, and `handoff.md`.
