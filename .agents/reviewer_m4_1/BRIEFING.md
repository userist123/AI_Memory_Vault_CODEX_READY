# BRIEFING — 2026-08-15T02:01:50+03:00

## Mission
Independent quality review and adversarial challenge of Milestone 4: Cognitive Loop & Multi-Agent Coordination.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: Reviewer & Critic
- Roles: reviewer, critic
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\reviewer_m4_1
- Original parent: 4d8619ff-fda6-4c9e-8801-2dbe0fd86141
- Milestone: Milestone 4 (Cognitive Loop & Multi-Agent Coordination)
- Instance: 1 of 1

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Check for integrity violations (hardcoded test outputs, facades, bypasses, fabricated logs, self-certifying work)
- Verify Trust Boundary Invariants (P0-P15) and Least Privilege Scoping
- Complete 5-component handoff report with explicit verdict (APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES)

## Current Parent

## Review Scope
- **Files reviewed**: `cognitive_core/executive.py`, `cognitive_core/reasoning.py`, `cognitive_core/recall.py`, `cognitive_core/reflection.py`, `cognitive_core/consolidation.py`, `cognitive_core/orchestrator.py`, `cognitive_core/agents/base_agent.py`, `cognitive_core/agents/router_agent.py`, `cognitive_core/agents/retrieval_agent.py`, `cognitive_core/agents/verifier_agent.py`, `cognitive_core/agents/consolidator_agent.py`, `cognitive_core/agents/critic_agent.py`, `cognitive_core/tests/*`
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/rules/vault_cognitive_rules.md`, `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`
- **Review criteria**: correctness, style, conformance, integrity, adversarial resilience

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**:
  - OODA Loop & Executive (`cognitive_core/executive.py`) — PASSED
  - Tree-of-Thought & ThoughtValidator (`cognitive_core/reasoning.py`) — PASSED
  - Recall Scoring & 10% Freshness Boost (`cognitive_core/recall.py`) — PASSED
  - 6-Stage Formal Reflexion (`cognitive_core/reflection.py`) — PASSED
  - SelfRefine Critique & Lesson Consolidation (`cognitive_core/consolidation.py`) — PASSED
  - Specialized Multi-Agent Workers & Orchestrator (`cognitive_core/agents/`, `orchestrator.py`) — PASSED
  - Integrity & Invariants P0-P15 — PASSED (0 violations)
- **Verdict**: APPROVE
- **Unverified claims**: None. All claims independently verified by test execution and source inspection.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - Subagent privilege escalation (Router/Retrieval/Verifier proposing/attesting/archiving) -> BLOCKED with PermissionError
  - AI self-verification via reflection/consolidation -> BLOCKED (all outputs proposed as REVIEW / unverified / inference)
  - Word boundary complexity triggers -> VERIFIED (no false positives on subwords like 'show')
  - Successor score inheritance with +10% freshness bonus -> VERIFIED mathematically
  - Atomic checkpointing (`wm.json`, `plan.json`) -> VERIFIED via temp file + os.replace + os.fsync
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None
- **Untested angles**: None within Milestone 4 scope

## Key Decisions Made
- Confirmed full compliance with all acceptance criteria for Milestone 4
- Issued formal verdict of APPROVE
