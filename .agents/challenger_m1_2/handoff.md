### 1.2 Specific Stress Scenarios Observed
1. **High-Concurrency SQLite WAL Hammer (16 Writer Threads + 8 Reader Threads)**:
   - 16 threads writing simultaneously (400 atomic insert/update operations) while 8 reader threads concurrently ran queries, BM25 searches, and CTE lineage queries.
   - Total database write operations: 400.
   - Result: 0 unhandled `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`, 0 deadlocks.
   - Database validation: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notes` returned exactly 400; `PRAGMA integrity_check` returned `ok`.
2. **Concurrent Multi-Hop Supersession Chains**:
   - 8 threads concurrently creating and superseding 5-node chains ($n_0 \to n_1 \to n_2 \to n_3 \to n_4$).
   - Result: All 40 notes correctly linked with reciprocal `supersedes` / `superseded_by` references in atomic `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transactions. `PRAGMA integrity_check` returned `ok`.
3. **Invariant Bypass Attempts (P0-P18 Trust Boundaries)**:
   - `Principal.AI_AGENT` attempting `propose()` with `verification="verified"` $\to$ Rejected with `ValueError("Verification status 'verified' cannot be set via propose")`. 0 rows inserted.
   - `Principal.AI_AGENT` attempting `update()` with `verification="verified"` $\to$ Rejected with `ValueError("Verification status 'verified' cannot be escalated via update")`.
   - `Principal.AI_AGENT` attempting `source_type` in `{"user", "official", "experience", "import"}` $\to$ All 4 rejected with `ValueError`.
   - `Principal.AI_AGENT` attempting proposal into `{"ACTIVE", "VERIFIED", "SUPERSEDED", "ARCHIVED", "RECONSOLIDATING"}` $\to$ All rejected with `ValueError`.
   - `Principal.AI_AGENT` attempting `promote()` or `attest()` $\to$ Blocked with `PermissionError`.
   - Mutation of `provenance.source_type` post-creation $\to$ Blocked with `ValueError("Field provenance.source_type is immutable post-creation")`.
4. **Recursive CTE Lineage Loop Injection & Cyclic Graphs**:
   - Self-supersession ($A \to A$) $\to$ Blocked with `ValueError("Self-supersession prohibited")`.
   - 2-node cycle ($A \to B \to A$) $\to$ Blocked with `ValueError("Cyclic supersession detected")`.
   - Direct raw database injection of 3-node cycle ($A \to B \to C \to A$) $\to$ `get_lineage(A, max_depth=20)` executed in 4.2ms, terminating cleanly without infinite recursion or stack overflow, returning distinct $\{A, B, C\}$.
5. **ACT-R Activation Mathematical Edge Cases**:
   - Future timestamps ($t_j > t \implies \text{negative elapsed time}$): handled gracefully by clamping $t - t_j \le 0 \implies \text{elapsed} = 0.001$, producing valid float activation without math domain errors.
   - Exact current time ($t = t_j \implies \text{elapsed} = 0$): clamped to 0.001, evaluated cleanly.
   - Zero decay ($d = 0.0$): evaluated to exact theoretical $\ln(N)$ ($N=3 \implies \ln(3) \approx 1.098612$).
   - Negative decay ($d = -0.5$): evaluated to valid positive float without numerical overflow.
   - Extreme decay ($d = 20.0$): attenuated to valid negative float.
   - Massive access history ($10,000$ accesses): calculated in $< 2\text{ms}$ with numerical stability ($\text{act} > 5.0$).
6. **Malicious SQL Injection & Special Character Resilience in BM25**:
   - Fuzzed with `' OR '1'='1`, `'; DROP TABLE notes; --`, `UNION SELECT * FROM notes --`, null bytes `\x00`, emoji, and empty strings.
   - Result: 0 SQL injection vulnerabilities, 0 schema alterations, table `notes` remained completely intact.

## 2. Logic Chain

1. **Concurrency Safety**:
   - SQLite connections are isolated per-thread using `threading.local()`, preventing multi-thread race conditions on the same C connection handle.
   - `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;` allows concurrent readers to query without blocking active writer transactions.
   - `PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000;` combined with explicit `BEGIN IMMEDIATE;` transactions prevents deadlock and writer starvation when multiple threads attempt concurrent writes.
   - Under a 16-thread simultaneous write hammer, all 400 transactions succeeded with zero data loss and valid SQLite page integrity.
2. **Security Invariant Enforcement**:
   - The permission checks in `jarvis.memory.invariants` are executed prior to storage mutations.
   - `AI_AGENT` cannot escalate its privileges, claim unearned verification status, or fabricate human provenance.
   - Immutability checks protect `provenance.source_type` and `lifecycle` from unauthorized mutations via standard `update()` calls.
3. **Graph & Lineage Robustness**:
   - The recursive CTE query `get_lineage` uses depth-bounded recursion (`lf.depth < max_depth`) and `UNION` set semantics, guaranteeing finite termination even when cyclic graphs are maliciously or accidentally present in storage.
   - Recall engine resolves active successors from superseded chains without infinite recursion.
4. **ACT-R Formula Soundness**:
   - The base-level decay formula $B_i = \ln\left(\sum_{j=1}^n (t - t_j)^{-d}\right)$ handles boundary conditions ($t \le t_j$, $d \le 0$, $N=0$, $N=10,000$) through positive clamping ($\text{elapsed} = 0.001$) and dormant thresholds ($B_i = -2.0$), preventing `ValueError: math domain error` or `ZeroDivisionError`.

## 3. Caveats

1. **In-Memory vs Multi-Process SQLite Locking**:
   - All concurrency tests were executed across multi-threaded thread pools within a single process. Multi-process concurrency (multiple independent OS processes accessing the same WAL file) relies on the same SQLite WAL file locks and OS POSIX/Windows byte-range locks.
2. **Hardware Voice Pipeline Scope**:
   - Concrete audio devices (physical microphone, ONNX Kokoro TTS model weights) will be integrated in Milestone 2. Milestone 1 storage, OODA loop, and memory invariants are fully verified.

---

## 4. Conclusion

The Milestone 1 persistence layer, SQLite WAL configuration, invariant enforcement (P0-P18), recursive CTE lineage traversal, and ACT-R mathematical models are robust, thread-safe, and secure against adversarial attacks. Zero data corruption, zero deadlocks, and zero unhandled exceptions were observed across 13 dedicated adversarial tests and 87 total test cases.

**Final Verdict**: **APPROVE**

## 5. Verification Method

To independently reproduce and verify the adversarial storage and concurrency tests:

```powershell
# Navigate to the target project directory
cd C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain

# Run the Challenger 2 adversarial storage and concurrency test suite
python -m pytest -v tests/unit/test_adversarial_storage_concurrency.py

# Run all project test suites (unit + e2e)
python -m pytest -v tests/
```

Expected output:
- `tests/unit/test_adversarial_storage_concurrency.py`: 13 passed in ~1.3s
- `tests/`: 87 passed in ~2.2s, 0 failures, 0 errors.
