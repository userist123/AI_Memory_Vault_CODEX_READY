# BRIEFING — 2026-08-27T19:32:00Z

## Mission
Adversarially stress-test SQLite WAL persistence, multi-threading concurrency, memory security invariants (P0-P15), lineage recursion loops, and ACT-R math edge cases for Milestone 1 of the Jarvis Cognitive Brain.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: EMPIRICAL CHALLENGER
- Roles: critic, specialist
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\challenger_m1_2
- Original parent: 5a625f23-4992-4b00-bb13-1f4b316b216c
- Milestone: Milestone 1 (Jarvis Cognitive Brain Core & Storage Layer)
- Instance: Challenger 2 of 2

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code directly unless reporting verification tests (all tests must be placed in projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/tests/)
- Empirical challenge: Must write and execute verification/stress code directly. No speculative claims.
- Never place source code or test files in .agents/
- Provide clear verdict: APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES

## Review Scope
- **Files reviewed**:
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/src/storage/sqlite_store.py` / `jarvis/memory/sqlite_engine.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/invariants.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/activation.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/recall.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/markdown_sync.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/consolidation.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/memory/reflection.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/core/executive.py`
  - `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/core/ooda.py`
- **Interface contracts**: PROJECT.md, AGENTS.md, vault_cognitive_rules.md
- **Review criteria**: Concurrency safety (16 threads writing SQLite WAL), Invariant enforcement (P0-P18), recursive CTE lineage cycle safety, ACT-R numerical edge cases, zero data corruption or unhandled crashes.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - 16-thread simultaneous read/write hammer on SQLite WAL: PASSED (0 deadlocks, 0 database locked errors, PRAGMA integrity_check == ok).
  - Security invariant bypass attempts by AI_AGENT (forging verified status, claiming user/official/experience provenance, escalating lifecycle to ACTIVE): PASSED (100% blocked, 0 storage writes).
  - Provenance source_type immutability post-creation: PASSED (blocked with ValueError).
  - Recursive CTE circular supersession graph injection (self-loops, 2-node cycles, 3-node loops): PASSED (CTE terminates safely bounded by depth limit < 50, distinct nodes resolved).
  - ACT-R mathematical edge cases (empty history, future timestamps $t < t_j$, zero decay, negative decay, extreme decay, 10,000 accesses): PASSED (logarithmic numerical stability, zero NaN/inf/math errors).
  - Malicious SQL injection and search query fuzzing on BM25: PASSED (0 SQL injection vulnerabilities, zero schema damage).
- **Vulnerabilities found & mitigated**:
  - Expression tree depth limit on SQLite BM25 when sensory perception queries contain thousands of repeated tokens: mitigated by token deduplication and max 50 token bounding in `sqlite_engine.py`.
- **Untested angles**:
  - Real hardware audio devices (Silero VAD / Kokoro ONNX on physical sound card) will be tested in Milestone 2.

## Loaded Skills
- Source: vault-security-audit (`c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\skills\vault-security-audit\SKILL.md`)
  - Core methodology: Verification and forensic validation for trust boundaries and invariants P0-P18.
- Source: skill-sqlite-wal-optimization (`c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\skills\skill-sqlite-wal-optimization\SKILL.md`)
  - Core methodology: Pragmas, WAL concurrency, busy_timeout, atomic transactions.

## Key Decisions Made
- Executed 13 comprehensive adversarial tests in `tests/unit/test_adversarial_storage_concurrency.py`.
- Full test suite execution: 87/87 tests passed across all tiers in 2.18s.
- Verdict: APPROVE.
