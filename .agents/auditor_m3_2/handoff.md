# Milestone 3 Remediation Forensic Audit: Handoff Report

## 1. Observation

### 1.1 Static Source Analysis Observations
- Inspected `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/agents/supervisor.py`:
  - **Lines 315–325**: Retry logic directly invokes `return await self._dispatch(task)` on the active worker without re-inserting the task into `self._async_queue`.
  - **Lines 300–311**: `_dispatch()` explicitly catches `asyncio.CancelledError`, constructs `TaskResult(..., status=TaskStatus.CANCELLED, ...)`, and calls `self._record_completion(task, task_res)`.
  - **Lines 66, 238–255, 369–401**: `self._cancelled_task_ids` tracks cancelled task IDs; `_dispatch()` verifies `is_cancelled` upon entry and exits immediately if true.
- Inspected `jarvis/agents/base.py`, `router.py`, `retrieval.py`, `verifier.py`, `consolidator.py`, `critic.py`, `models.py`:
  - Zero hardcoded test names, zero bypass mocks, zero constant return shortcuts.
  - Capability matrix `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` and P0–P18 invariants are enforced at runtime via `ScopedStorageProxy`.

### 1.2 Test Execution Results
- **Full Test Suite**:
  - Command: `python -m pytest`
  - Output: `323 passed in 10.90s` (Exit code: 0)
- **Targeted Multi-Agent & Challenger Suite**:
  - Command: `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_multi_agent.py tests/unit/test_agent_least_privilege.py tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_2_workers.py tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_adversarial_deep.py tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_retry.py tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_cancellation.py tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_pending_cancel.py tests/e2e/tier1_features/test_t1_multi_agent.py -v`
  - Output: `81 passed in 4.06s` (Exit code: 0)
- **Workspace State**:
  - 0 pre-populated logs or test artifacts.

## 2. Logic Chain

1. **Defect 1 (Retry Race Condition)**:
   - *Observation*: `_dispatch()` increments `task.retry_count` and recurses sequentially on the executing worker without calling `_async_queue.put_nowait()`.
   - *Inference*: No extra job item is pushed to the queue; other idle workers in the pool cannot pop a duplicate task.
   - *Empirical Proof*: `test_retry_duplicate_execution_race` passes with exactly 2 recorded executions.

2. **Defect 2 (Worker Death on CancelledError)**:
   - *Observation*: `_dispatch()` catches `asyncio.CancelledError`, resolves the awaiting future to `TaskStatus.CANCELLED`, and returns gracefully to `_worker_loop()`.
   - *Inference*: `CancelledError` from in-flight task execution does not bubble up to `_worker_loop()`'s outer loop breaker.
   - *Empirical Proof*: `test_worker_survives_asyncio_cancelled_error` confirms the single worker remains alive and executes subsequent tasks without hanging.

3. **Defect 3 (Pending Task Cancellation)**:
   - *Observation*: `cancel_tasks_matching()` records cancelled task IDs into `self._cancelled_task_ids`. `_dispatch()` checks this set upon dequeue.
   - *Inference*: Even if an item remains in `asyncio.PriorityQueue`, the worker immediately drops it with `TaskStatus.CANCELLED` upon popping.
   - *Empirical Proof*: `test_cancelled_pending_task_must_not_execute` confirms zero uncancelled executions.

4. **Integrity & Authenticity**:
   - *Observation*: Grep searches and AST inspection confirm absence of dummy facades or test-specific hardcoding.
   - *Inference*: All 323 passing tests reflect authentic execution against production modules.

## 3. Caveats

No caveats. All remediation logic was directly verified via static inspection and empirical test execution. Storage integrity and SQLite WAL transaction boundaries remain intact.

---

## 4. Conclusion

**Verdict**: **CLEAN**
Milestone 3 remediation is authentic, production-grade, and free of integrity violations. The implementation is approved for Milestone 4 progression.

## 5. Verification Method

To independently verify:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain

# 1. Verify targeted challenger bug reproducers
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_retry.py tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_cancellation.py tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_bug_pending_cancel.py tests/unit/test_challenger_m3_adversarial_deep.py -v

# 2. Run full repository test suite
python -m pytest
```
