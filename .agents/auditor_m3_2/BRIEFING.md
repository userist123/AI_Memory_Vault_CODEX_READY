# BRIEFING — 2026-08-28T14:13:00Z

## Mission
Conduct forensic integrity audit and adversarial verification on Milestone 3 concurrency, lifecycle remediation, and supervisor worker orchestration.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: forensic_auditor
- Roles: critic, specialist, auditor
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\auditor_m3_2
- Original parent: 8b531079-7cca-4ec6-a0e3-4ce625943430
- Target: Milestone 3 Multi-Agent Workers & Lifecycle Remediation

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Audit-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Trust NOTHING — verify everything independently
- Integrity Mode: demo (from ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md)
- Follow 2-phase forensic verification procedure

## Audit Scope
- **Work product**: `projects/jarvis_cognitive_brain/jarvis/agents/supervisor.py`, `jarvis/agents/*.py`, and associated test suites
- **Profile loaded**: General Project (Demo Mode)
- **Audit type**: forensic integrity check

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**: 
  - Assumption 1: Retry logic handles failure and recursion without race condition or queue duplication (CONFIRMED CLEAN).
  - Assumption 2: CancelledError does not kill worker loops or leave futures hung (CONFIRMED CLEAN).
  - Assumption 3: Pending cancelled tasks never execute on idle workers (CONFIRMED CLEAN).
  - Assumption 4: No test bypasses, dummy returns, or mock facades exist in production `jarvis/agents/` (CONFIRMED CLEAN).
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None. All previous challenger defects have been cleanly resolved.
- **Untested angles**: Full static scan and independent 323-test execution complete.

## Loaded Skills
- **Source**: vault-security-audit
- **Local copy**: N/A
- **Core methodology**: Independent behavioral test execution, invariant verification, zero-trust static inspection.

## Audit Progress
- **Phase**: complete
- **Checks completed**: [Static analysis, Facade/hardcode search, Pre-populated artifact check, Independent pytest run (323/323), Concurrency/lifecycle stress test, Final report & handoff written]
- **Checks remaining**: None
- **Findings so far**: CLEAN

## Key Decisions Made
- Confirmed Integrity Mode: Demo directly from ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md.
- Verified genuine production fixes in `jarvis/agents/supervisor.py`.
- Formally issued binary verdict: CLEAN.

## Artifact Index
- `DISPATCH.md` — Incoming dispatch log
- `BRIEFING.md` — Persistent situational awareness
- `progress.md` — Liveness heartbeat
- `report.md` — Detailed forensic audit report
- `handoff.md` — 5-component handoff report
