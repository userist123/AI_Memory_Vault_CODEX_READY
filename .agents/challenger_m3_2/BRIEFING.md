# BRIEFING — 2026-08-14T20:25:00Z

## Mission
Empirical adversarial challenge and stress testing of Milestone 3 Security Invariants & Attestation Gates under concurrent and edge-case conditions.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: challenger
- Roles: critic, specialist
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\challenger_m3_2
- Original parent: d4ac85d0-8437-44da-a1a0-09c9069218d5
- Milestone: Milestone 3
- Instance: 1 of 1

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code (adversarial test files in memory_controller/tests/ or cognitive_core/tests/ are test harnesses)
- Review and challenge Milestone 3 Security Invariants & Attestation Gates
- Test multi-threaded / concurrent attestation race conditions
- Test boundary input fuzzing for attest() arguments
- Verify audit log SHA-256 chain integrity under failed security attempts
- Run full pytest suite and adversarial stress harness
- Report detailed findings and verdict (APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES) in handoff.md

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**: memory_controller/controller.py, memory_controller/authorizer.py, memory_controller/audit/logger.py, cognitive_core/tool_router.py, cognitive_core/learning.py, memory_controller/storage/sqlite_engine.py
- **Interface contracts**: PROJECT.md, AGENTS.md, vault_cognitive_rules.md
- **Review criteria**: P0-P15 Security Invariants, Attestation Gates, Concurrency/Race condition safety, Fuzzing resilience, Audit log hash chain integrity

## Key Decisions Made
- Authored and executed 12 rigorous empirical stress tests in `memory_controller/tests/test_milestone3_empirical_challenge.py`.
- Verified SQLite WAL mode multi-threaded concurrency with concurrent `attest()`, `update()`, and hostile escalation attempts.
- Fuzzed `attest()` arguments across empty strings, whitespace, null bytes, SQL injections, JSON injections, XSS payloads, Unicode RTL overrides, and 20KB large strings.
- Verified SHA-256 tamper-evident hash chaining under sequential and multi-threaded attack cascades with 100% integrity validation.
- Validated ToolRouter high-risk action gating (`delete_canonical`, `modify_raw_imports`, `attest`) and reconciliation boundaries guarding `verified` memories against automated mutations, supersessions, and archival.
- Validated Continual Learning confidence promotion rules (strictly requiring `source_type="execution"` for promotion to `very_high`).

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**: 
  1. Multi-threaded race condition between HUMAN/ADMIN `attest()` and AI `update()` on the same SQLite WAL record: Invariants held 100%, no state corruption or unauthorized elevation.
  2. Input fuzzing on `attest()` parameters: Rejected empty/whitespace strings with ValueError, safely stored and escaped hostile characters/Unicode without breaking SQLite or audit log.
  3. Audit log SHA-256 chain integrity under failed attack barrages: Chain validated with 0 anomalies.
- **Vulnerabilities found**: 0 exploitable vulnerabilities in production codebase (`SQLiteStorageEngine` and `FileStorageEngine` guarantee strict atomicity and non-persistence on rejection). Note that in-memory `StorageEngine` modifies dict in-place if an exception occurs mid-method, but production deployment uses SQLite/File engine which deserialize copies on `get()`.
- **Untested angles**: None.

## Loaded Skills
- **Source**: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\skills\vault-security-audit\SKILL.md
- **Local copy**: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\skills\vault-security-audit\SKILL.md
- **Core methodology**: Run adversarial test suites, verify audit log integrity, test database concurrency and SQLite constraints.
