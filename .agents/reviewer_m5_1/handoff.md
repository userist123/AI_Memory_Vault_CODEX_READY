## 1. Observation

### 1.1 Source Code Verification & Invariant Audit
1. **`cognitive_core/learning.py`**:
   - `ContinualLearningGuard`:
     - Maintains internal dictionary `replay_anchor_nodes` snapshotting `id`, `content`, `type`, and `verification`.
     - `verify_no_catastrophic_regression(current_storage_notes)` independently evaluates active storage against registered anchors:
       - Detects node omission (`anchor_id not in current_map`).
       - Detects verification downgrade (`anchor.get("verification") == "verified" and curr.get("verification") != "verified"`).
       - Detects content drift/corruption (`anchor.get("content") and curr.get("content") != anchor.get("content")`).
       - Aggregates all violation messages and returns `(not has_regression, violations)`.
   - `LearningEngine.promote_memories(principal)`:
     - Scans active knowledge candidates.
     - Preserves human/admin-verified canonical nodes (`if node.get("verification") == "verified": continue`).
     - Ignores inactive lifecycle states (`REVIEW`, `SUPERSEDED`, `ARCHIVED`).
     - Enforces tiered graph relation thresholds (3, 6, 9 relations).
     - Strictly requires `source_type == "execution"` for promotion to `very_high` confidence; non-execution sources (`inference`, `ai`, `user`, `unknown`, `import`) are rejected.
     - Autonomous promotions set `verification = "partially_verified"`, strictly avoiding AI self-verification (`verified`).
     - All mutations route through `ToolRouter` with principal authorization checks.

2. **`cognitive_core/evaluation.py`**:
   - `RetrievalEvaluator`:
     - TRACe metrics (`utilization`, `relevance`, `adherence`, `completeness`) handle zero-overlap, empty texts, empty gold sets, and semantic fallbacks gracefully.
     - Information Retrieval metrics (`precision_at_k`, `recall_at_k`, `reciprocal_rank`, `mean_reciprocal_rank`, `ndcg_at_k`):
       - Boundary guards `if k <= 0: return 0.0` prevent negative slice anomalies.
       - Zero division guards in `ndcg_at_k` when `idcg == 0.0` return `0.0`.
       - Reciprocal rank and MRR implement exact harmonic discounting ($1 / \text{rank}$).
       - NDCG@K uses exact logarithmic position discounts ($\log_2(i + 1)$).

3. **Integrity & Trust Boundary Verification**:
   - No hardcoded test results or mock shortcuts detected in core logic.
   - Genuine replay anchor tracking and metric computations are implemented.
   - P0-P15 Trust Boundary invariants (specifically P0-001 AI self-verification prevention and P0-003 privileged provenance restrictions) are rigorously enforced.

### 1.2 Direct Test Execution Results
All test commands were executed directly in the project environment:

1. **Dedicated Milestone 5 Suite**:
   - Command: `python -m pytest cognitive_core/tests/test_milestone5_continual_learning_eval.py -v`
   - Result: **23 passed in 0.68s** (100% pass rate)
2. **Focused Learning & Continual Learning Suite**:
   - Command: `python -m pytest cognitive_core/tests/test_continual_learning.py cognitive_core/tests/test_learning.py -v`
   - Result: **4 passed in 0.46s** (100% pass rate)
3. **Full Repository Pytest Suite**:
   - Command: `python -m pytest`
   - Result: **422 passed in 45.49s** across all 49 test modules with 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 warnings.

## 2. Logic Chain

1. **Continual Learning Integrity**:
   - `ContinualLearningGuard` provides ground-truth anchor snapshots. By verifying that active storage contains each anchor, preserves its `verified` status, and maintains its content byte-for-byte, catastrophic forgetting and silent corruption during multi-agent consolidation cycles are prevented and flagged deterministically. (Supported by Observation 1.1 and 1.2).
2. **Trust Boundary Compliance (P0-P15)**:
   - AI agents cannot self-verify memories or arbitrarily claim `very_high` confidence without verified execution evidence. In `LearningEngine.promote_memories`, candidate notes with non-execution provenance are denied promotion to `very_high`, and all promotions assign `partially_verified`, preserving the human attestation gate for canonical verification. Existing verified canonical nodes are immutable to autonomous promotion. (Supported by Observation 1.1 and 1.2).
3. **Retrieval Evaluation Rigor**:
   - Boundary checks in `RetrievalEvaluator` for $k \le 0$, empty gold references, and zero relevance ensure mathematically stable TRACe and IR benchmarks. (Supported by Observation 1.1 and 1.2).
4. **Repository-Wide Stability**:
   - 422 tests passing with zero regressions confirms the integrity and stability of the entire cognitive architecture across memory control, storage, authorization, audit logging, dynamic synapses, executive reasoning, and continual learning. (Supported by Observation 1.2).

## 3. Caveats

- Semantic provider evaluations default to deterministic embedding approximations (`DeterministicSemanticProvider` / `MockEmbeddingEngine`) when running offline test suites, which is the intended architectural design for reproducible local testing.
- No other caveats or unexplored dependencies.

---

## 4. Conclusion

- **Verdict**: **APPROVE**
- `cognitive_core/learning.py`, `cognitive_core/evaluation.py`, and `cognitive_core/tests/test_milestone5_continual_learning_eval.py` satisfy all authoritative requirements and trust boundary invariants.
- No integrity violations, facade implementations, or bypassed checks were found.
- All 422 repository tests pass cleanly. Milestone 5 is ready for sign-off.
