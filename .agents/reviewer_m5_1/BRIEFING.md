# BRIEFING — 2026-08-15T02:30:30Z

## Mission
Conduct independent quality and adversarial review of Milestone 5 (Continual Learning & Confidence Promotion Review), verifying ContinualLearningGuard, LearningEngine confidence promotion, TRACe/IR benchmarks, test suites, and integrity checks.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: reviewer_and_adversarial_critic
- Roles: reviewer, critic
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\reviewer_m5_1
- Original parent: 4b331fbc-eb8c-41a5-8ea8-e64218064557
- Milestone: Milestone 5 (Continual Learning & Confidence Promotion Review)
- Instance: 1 of 1

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Check for integrity violations (hardcoding, facade, bypassed tasks, fabricated verification)
- Enforce Trust Boundary Invariants P0-P15 and cognitive operating rules

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**: `cognitive_core/learning.py`, `cognitive_core/evaluation.py`, `cognitive_core/tests/test_milestone5_continual_learning_eval.py`, `cognitive_core/tests/test_continual_learning.py`, `cognitive_core/tests/test_learning.py`
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/rules/vault_cognitive_rules.md`
- **Review criteria**: correctness, regression protection, trust boundary compliance, adversarial robustness, test suite thoroughness

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**: `cognitive_core/learning.py`, `cognitive_core/evaluation.py`, `cognitive_core/tests/test_milestone5_continual_learning_eval.py`, `cognitive_core/tests/test_continual_learning.py`, `cognitive_core/tests/test_learning.py`
- **Verdict**: APPROVE
- **Unverified claims**: None. All claims verified independently via execution and code inspection.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - ContinualLearningGuard catches anchor node deletion: CONFIRMED
  - ContinualLearningGuard catches verification downgrades (`verified` -> `unverified`/`partially_verified`): CONFIRMED
  - ContinualLearningGuard catches content drift and erasure: CONFIRMED
  - ContinualLearningGuard aggregates multi-node violations: CONFIRMED
  - LearningEngine enforces `execution` provenance for `very_high` confidence: CONFIRMED
  - LearningEngine prevents AI self-verification (`partially_verified` assigned, never `verified`): CONFIRMED
  - LearningEngine protects human/admin-verified canonical nodes from mutation: CONFIRMED
  - RetrievalEvaluator handles edge cases (zero division, `k <= 0`, empty ground truths): CONFIRMED
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None.
- **Untested angles**: None.

## Key Decisions Made
- Confirmed full compliance with Trust Boundary Invariants P0-P15 and AGENTS.md operating contract.
- Verified 100% test pass rate across 422 tests (0 failures, 0 errors).
- Issued APPROVE verdict.
