# BRIEFING — 2026-08-14T20:14:00Z

## Mission
Review Milestone 2: Storage, WAL & Audit Integrity. Perform objective quality review and adversarial stress-testing on SQLite engine, atomic checkpointing in working memory and planning, and test suite.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: reviewer_critic
- Roles: reviewer, critic
- Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\.agents\reviewer_m2_1
- Original parent: e71a16ec-5ebc-4ca2-ab0f-6beddef86e94
- Milestone: Milestone 2 (Storage, WAL & Audit Integrity)
- Instance: 1 of 1

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Thoroughly check for integrity violations, facades, bypasses, hardcoded results
- Strictly verify WAL mode, busy_timeout=5000, BEGIN IMMEDIATE, recursive CTE lineage traversal, atomic write routines (os.replace)

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**:
  - `memory_controller/storage/sqlite_engine.py`
  - `cognitive_core/working_memory.py`
  - `cognitive_core/planning.py`
  - `memory_controller/audit/logger.py`
  - `memory_controller/tests/test_sqlite_storage.py`
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/rules/vault_cognitive_rules.md`
- **Review criteria**: Correctness, concurrency/thread safety, WAL pragmas, transaction atomicity, atomic checkpointing (os.replace), CTE correctness, test coverage, adversarial robustness.

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**:
  - `memory_controller/storage/sqlite_engine.py`: Verified schema constraints, thread-local connection pool with `_lock`, PRAGMAs (`journal_mode=WAL`, `busy_timeout=5000`, `foreign_keys=ON`, `synchronous=NORMAL`), `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction safety with rollback handling, recursive CTE with depth bound 50, and checkpointing.
  - `cognitive_core/working_memory.py`: Verified `save_state` and `load_state` with `mkstemp` + `os.fdopen` + `os.fsync` + `os.replace` + cleanup pattern.
  - `cognitive_core/planning.py`: Verified `ActivePlan.save_state` and `load_state` atomic file replace pattern.
  - `memory_controller/audit/logger.py`: Verified SHA-256 hash chaining and tamper detection.
  - Pytest test execution: `memory_controller/tests/test_sqlite_storage.py` (9/9 passed), full suite (218/218 passed).
- **Verdict**: APPROVE
- **Unverified claims**: None. All claims independently verified.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - Concurrency contention with multiple concurrent reader/writer threads: PASSED.
  - SQLite recursion cycle handling (A -> B -> C -> A) and depth limit (>50 notes): PASSED.
  - Rollback on check constraint violation: PASSED.
  - Audit log tampering (modified actor, corrupted prev_hash, deleted lines, malformed JSON): PASSED.
  - Atomic file write on Windows (`os.replace` on open vs closed fd): PASSED.
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None.
- **Untested angles**: Network filesystem (NFS/SMB) lock semantics (standard SQLite limitation, outside scope of local vault).

## Key Decisions Made
- Confirmed full compliance with Milestone 2 requirements and integrity rules. Issued verdict APPROVE.
