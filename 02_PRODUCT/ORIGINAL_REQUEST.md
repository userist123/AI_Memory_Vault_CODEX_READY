Transform the AI Memory Vault into a fully self-improving, autonomous Cognitive Brain with integrated multi-agent execution, continuous self-reflection, and robust memory governance.

Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY

## Requirements

### R1. Cognitive Loop Self-Execution & Autonomous Task Processing
The cognitive core must autonomously process user goals through the full OODA sequence: Observe (Query classification) -> Retrieve (Associative & Semantic recall) -> Reason (Tree-of-Thought) -> Plan (Multi-step execution) -> Act (ToolRouter) -> Reflect (Formal Reflexion) -> Consolidate (Learning & Deduplication).

### R2. Strict Trust Boundary & Attestation Guarantees
Preserve and enforce all P0-P15 security invariants: AI agents must never self-verify or forge user/official provenance. All promotions to human-verified canonical memory must flow through audited attestation gates.

### R3. High-Concurrency SQLite WAL Persistence & Vector Index Synchronization
Maintain SQLite with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and BEGIN IMMEDIATE atomic transactions as the authoritative source of truth, synchronizing active memory embeddings with secondary vector indexes.

### R4. Specialized Multi-Agent Worker Coordination
Execute memory workflows using least-privilege worker subagents (Router, Retrieval, Verifier, Consolidator, Critic) with bounded step execution and automatic maintenance triggers.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Security & Invariants
- [ ] All 197+ unit, integration, and adversarial security tests in `pytest` pass with 0 failures.
- [ ] AI Agent attempts to propose `verification="verified"` or claim privileged provenance (`user`, `official`) result in strict rejection without partial database writes.
- [ ] SHA-256 audit log hash chain validates with 0 tampering anomalies.

### Cognitive Retrieval & Reasoning
- [ ] TRACe metrics (Utilization, Relevance, Adherence, Completeness) and IR benchmarks (Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR, NDCG@K) evaluate above standard baseline thresholds.
- [ ] Superseded notes automatically transfer semantic relevance scores to active successor nodes with a 10% freshness bonus.
- [ ] Complex multi-step queries automatically trigger Tree-of-Thought branch exploration and ThoughtValidator consistency checking.

### Memory Lifecycle & Continual Learning
- [ ] Ephemeral REVIEW lessons are synthesized into consolidated canonical knowledge through SelfRefine critique filters.
- [ ] Confidence promotion to `very_high` strictly requires verifiable execution evidence (`source_type="execution"`).
- [ ] `ContinualLearningGuard` detects and prevents catastrophic forgetting across registered anchor memories.

<USER_REQUEST>
Building a local, fully autonomous, self-improving Cognitive Brain ("Creier Vorbitor") featuring a complete cognitive OODA loop (Observe, Retrieve, Reason, Plan, Act, Reflect, Consolidate), integrated with a real-time cascading audio pipeline (STT Silero VAD + Faster-Whisper, TTS Kokoro-82M with barge-in/AEC), multi-agent worker coordination, a local Home Assistant IoT REST API simulation, and an ultra-modern 3D Web HUD interface.

Working directory: `C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain`
Integrity mode: demo

## Requirements

### R1. Cognitive Loop Self-Execution & Memory Persistent Storage
Establish a local daemon utilizing the Google Antigravity SDK. Configured out-of-the-box to prioritize local LLMs (e.g., via Ollama running local models like `qwen2.5-coder`), but structured modularly to allow simple configuration-level swapping to external API models (Gemini API, Claude API, etc.) in the future. Implement a full stateful OODA cycle:
- **Observe**: Classify incoming vocal/text requests.
- **Retrieve**: Use associative and semantic recall to fetch context from an Obsidian-style markdown database and a persistent database.
- **Reason/Plan**: Formulate structured multi-step plans.
- **Act**: Route tool calls via FastMCP.
- **Reflect/Consolidate**: Run self-reflection (Reflexion) and store consolidated lessons back to the long-term memory.

### R2. Cascaded Audio Pipeline with Barge-in
Implement a high-performance audio engine:
- **STT**: Continuous audio capture with a Silero VAD classifier (500ms silence threshold) segmenting input for a local `faster-whisper` engine.
- **TTS**: Local text-to-speech synthesis using the `Kokoro-82M` model via ONNX.
- **Barge-in/AEC**: An immediate audio interruption mechanism that halts TTS output playback and cancels active LLM generation on VAD speech detection.

### R3. Multi-Agent Worker Orchestration
Coordinate execution using a supervisor and specialized, least-privilege agent workers (Router, Retrieval, Verifier, Consolidator, Critic) to process background tasks (e.g., gathering data, verifying memory compliance) without blocking the primary real-time voice loop.

### R4. FastMCP & IoT Home Assistant Integration
Implement a FastMCP tool server (`JarvisControls`) that provides validated tools to query and manipulate IoT device states over a local REST API (`/api/states`). Deliver a lightweight local simulator script to mock Home Assistant REST endpoints for reliable offline testing.

### R5. Ultra-Modern GUI Dashboard & Web HUD
Build a highly polished, responsive Web UI dashboard and 3D visualizer showing:
- Active vocal states (Idle, Listening, Thinking, Speaking) with dynamic sound reactivity.
- Visual representation of the active "thoughts" (OODA execution stages) and memory graphs/citations.
- System health meters and configuration settings.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Soundness & Integration
- [ ] Codebase compiles and runs cleanly under Python 3.12+.
- [ ] Cognitive OODA loop executes end-to-end, searching, planning, and updating the memory logs.
- [ ] Audio pipeline transcribes spoken queries and plays back responses under 300ms Time-To-First-Byte (TTFB) for synthesis.
- [ ] Barge-in events successfully halt active audio playback and interrupt ongoing LLM execution.
- [ ] Home Assistant simulated REST API accurately handles device state queries and command posts.
- [ ] The dashboard HUD visualizes voice states, OODA thoughts, and memory nodes without crashing.

RESUME INSTRUCTION: The project has already completed Milestone 1 (Cognitive OODA loop, modular LLM provider layer, and memory persistence engine are implemented under C:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY\projects\jarvis_cognitive_brain and 113+ tests are passing cleanly). Please scan the existing codebase and test suite, verify the state of the project, and resume execution starting with Milestone 2: Cascaded Audio Pipeline (STT Silero VAD + Faster-Whisper, TTS Kokoro-82M ONNX, and Barge-in/AEC interruption) and onwards.
