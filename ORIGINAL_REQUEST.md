Transform the AI Memory Vault into a fully self-improving, autonomous Cognitive Brain with integrated multi-agent execution, continuous self-reflection, and robust memory governance.

Working directory: c:\Users\Marius\Documents\Codex\AI_Memory_Vault_CODEX_READY

## Requirements

### R1. Cognitive Loop Self-Execution & Autonomous Task Processing
The cognitive core must autonomously process user goals through the full OODA sequence: Observe (Query classification) -> Retrieve (Associative & Semantic recall) -> Reason (Tree-of-Thought) -> Plan (Multi-step execution) -> Act (ToolRouter) -> Reflect (Formal Reflexion) -> Consolidate (Learning & Deduplication).

### R2. Strict Trust Boundary & Attestation Guarantees
Preserve and enforce all P0-P15 security invariants: AI agents must never self-verify or forge user/official provenance. All promotions to human-verified canonical memory must flow through audited attestation gates.

### R3. High-Concurrency SQLite WAL Persistence & Vector Index Synchronization
Maintain SQLite with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and BEGIN IMMEDIATE atomic transactions as the authoritative source of truth, synchronizing active memory embeddings with secondary vector indexes.

### R4. Specialized Multi-Agent Worker Coordination
Execute memory workflows using least-privilege worker subagents (Router, Retrieval, Verifier, Consolidator, Critic) with bounded step execution and automatic maintenance triggers.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Security & Invariants
- [ ] All 197+ unit, integration, and adversarial security tests in `pytest` pass with 0 failures.
- [ ] AI Agent attempts to propose `verification="verified"` or claim privileged provenance (`user`, `official`) result in strict rejection without partial database writes.
- [ ] SHA-256 audit log hash chain validates with 0 tampering anomalies.

### Cognitive Retrieval & Reasoning
- [ ] TRACe metrics (Utilization, Relevance, Adherence, Completeness) and IR benchmarks (Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR, NDCG@K) evaluate above standard baseline thresholds.
- [ ] Superseded notes automatically transfer semantic relevance scores to active successor nodes with a 10% freshness bonus.
- [ ] Complex multi-step queries automatically trigger Tree-of-Thought branch exploration and ThoughtValidator consistency checking.

### Memory Lifecycle & Continual Learning
- [ ] Ephemeral REVIEW lessons are synthesized into consolidated canonical knowledge through SelfRefine critique filters.
- [ ] Confidence promotion to `very_high` strictly requires verifiable execution evidence (`source_type="execution"`).
- [ ] `ContinualLearningGuard` detects and prevents catastrophic forgetting across registered anchor memories.
